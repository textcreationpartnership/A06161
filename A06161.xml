            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>That we ſhould walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and be perfect.</hi> Abſolute
perfection God doth not there meane, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionall: which is, when we
deſire and endeavour with <hi>David,</hi> to have all our waies conformed to
all Gods Statutes. Intentionall perfection, <pb facs="tcp:9267:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>is no other but
ſincere walking; and what this is, this tract now humbly preſented to your
Ladyſhip, will plainely make knowne unto you. A ſincere heart, <hi>is a
heart after Gods owne heart;</hi> which of all jewells which the Gentry, and
Nobility weare, is the moſt reſplendent, in the breaſt and boſome to be
worne. The richeſt jeweller, Chriſt, proffers this pearle of great price,
<hi>without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or money-worth,</hi> and the multitude ſleight it, as a
low priſed thing, not worth the ſeeking after; but your Ladyſhip hath
otherwiſe learned Chriſt: Many things Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, may be convenient, but one is
neceſſarie; to wit, a ſincere heart. The acquiring of this, is the worke
of our whole life: the ſetting forth of this, in its nature and luſtre, is
the worke <pb facs="tcp:9267:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Chriſts Miniſters; the leaſt, and

of thy ſtudy; Chriſt and thine owne heart. The latter; to know thine owne
miſery; the former, to know Gods rich mercy, and how thou mayſt be made
partaker of it. So deceitfull is the heart of man naturally, that he
<hi>thinkes himſelfe rich, and increaſed in goods,</hi> and knowes not that
he <hi>is poore, and blind miſerable, wretched, and naked.</hi> And untill
this deceit and unſoundneſſe be diſcovered, men will never ſeeke out
for Chriſt, which is that <hi>Gold tried in the fire,</hi> which indeed makes
poore man rich; and that <hi>white rayment, Iohn</hi> ſpeakes of, which
indeed makes naked man comely, and covers all his deformity, from the
all-ſeeing eye of him, which is perfect purity. The true knowledge of thine
owne heart, this little tract will helpe thee to, by the bleſſing of God;
if thou ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſe it, and humbly ſeeke to him, who is the
ſearcher and diſcoverer of all hearts, to go <pb facs="tcp:9267:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>along with
thee, in the reading of it. Which when once thou haſt gotten, thou wilt be
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, and reſtleſſe till thou
haſt obtained it. And this when acquired, will reſolve thy doubting,
comfort thy mourning, and ſtabliſh thy ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering ſoule: 'twill give

which that it may runne in the veines of you all, unto your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

            <p>No condition is trucly joyous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and no condition is truely
dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous with ſincerity. If a man be never ſo rich, never ſo honourable,
yet if not withall ſincere, there is no true joy in ſuch a man: he laughes,
but in the midſt of laughter, his heart is oft times ſad, and his
conſcience ſpoiles his ſport. On the other hand; if a man be never ſo
poore, never ſo much oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <pb n="3" facs="tcp:9267:10"/>which is the
deadlieſt, and the moſt oppoſite enemy to joy of all, yet if that man be
ſincere, his heart may be as full of joy, as it can hold, for all this, as
you may ſee in theſe words read, <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the
teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity,
&amp;c. Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> have beene ſincere ſervants of
Jeſus Chriſt, for the good of his Church amongſt the Gentiles, and in
this they had tranſcendant comfort in the midſt of all the miſery they
met withall.</p>
            <p>'Tis not miſery, but ſinne, that robs the ſoule of joy. Let
a man labour to live ſincerely, and then let men and divels doe what they
can, or will, ſuch a man ſhall never be bereaft of joy: he ſhall have joy
in poverty, joy in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, he ſhall have joy in priſon, as much as in
liberty, and much more; So had <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> which made
them thus bravely breake out in the midſt of miſery, <hi>For our rejoycing

            <p>Divine joy is ſet forth unto us in this Text, according to its

divine joy, is the <hi>righteous man,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

[our] reioycing, &amp;c.</hi> that is, we which are ſincere: hypocrits have

and it notes joy as it hath ſtrongly ſeiſed upon the tongue, and face,
and hands, without; ſo that it is all one as if the Apoſtle had ſaid,
<hi>the cauſe of our ſtrong and open rejoycing is this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What? That they had made proviſion <pb n="6" facs="tcp:9267:12"/>for the

Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall riſe: The proper riſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine joy, is the teſtimony of a
pure conſcience, concerning the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a mans converſation;
and this was the riſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Timothies</hi> joy, in
affliction. <hi>Their conſcience bore wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with them, that in
integrity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, not in flattery, policie, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
they had preached and lived amongſt all men, as thoſe that depended upon
the ſtrength and aid of Chriſtin everything, and not upon any abilities of
their owne, though they were endowed with greater humane gifts then any the
falſe Apoſtles had. Thus, they carried themſelves in a plaine, downright,
faithfull way, where ever they came to publiſh the Goſpell of Chriſt, but
ſpecially amongſt the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi> To other Churches <hi>Paul</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9267:12"/>(God willing) I ſhall ſhew unto you. The Church of the

            <p>Sincerity is either <hi>Morall</hi> or <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall.</hi>
Morall ſincerity, I call ſuch a qualification of ſpirit, as leads a man
to doe to others, as he would be done to himſelfe. A rectitude of ſpirit in
relation to men. Such a ſincere man ('tis probable) was <hi>Abimelech</hi>
King of <hi>Gerar.</hi> He tooke <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife unto him, ſhe being
very beautifull, but this he would not have done, had he knowne her to have
beene <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife; for <hi>Abraham</hi> had told him; that ſhe was
his ſiſter; and therefore God bore witneſſe with <hi>Abimelech</hi>
concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <pb n="12" facs="tcp:9267:15"/>his integrity. <hi>In the integrity of my
heart, and innocency of my hands have I done this,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Abimelech;</hi> and God ſaid unto him, <hi>yea I know that thou didſt
this in the integrity of thy heart, Gen.</hi> 20.6. Such a ſincere man, was
that yong man which came to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and told him, that he had <hi>kept
all the Commandements from his youth.</hi> He gave to every man his due, and
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved orderly amongſt his neighbours, and therefore he judged himſelfe as
good as needed to be.</p>
            <p>Morall ſincerity, is cloſe hypocriſie. Morall ſincerity is
like ſome counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Pearles, which make a faire ſhew to looke upon, but
deceive both buyer and beholder. Multitudes thinke that becauſe their
ſpirits are ſo over-ruled by God, that they doe no injury to man, that
therefore they are endowed with <hi>godly ſincerity,</hi>

the ſincerity of God too; for 'tis his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining corrupt man, which
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be as prophane towards man outwardly, as he is towards God 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9267:15"/>inwardly. <hi>I withheld thee from ſinning againſt

is but an out-ſide holy man, but obſerves it not; and therefore (I think)
called by ſome, a cloſe hypocrit. But this is not that <hi>ſincerity of
God,</hi> which my Text ſpeaks of.</p>

That is, that ſincerity, which is after a ſpeciall manner wrought of God,
in the heart of man. So likewiſe elſe-where the Apoſtle ſolemnely

<hi>And this I pray</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that your love may abound,

            <p>The heart of man naturally is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull,</hi> not ſincere;
<hi>deſperately wicked,</hi> not truely good; more oppoſite to ſincerity
then to any thing; as things corrupted, carry a greater diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to
what they were, then to any thing elſe which they never were. The Divell is
more oppoſite to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of an Angell which once he had, then to
any lower good, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver formally had; which is a torment that lyes upon

<hi>conſtantly</hi> laborious, <hi>willingly</hi> labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and laborious
according to <hi>all his ſtrength.</hi> Firſt, ſincerity is ſuch a
ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke of God upon the ſoule, that it makes a man
<hi>laborious</hi> to doe the Will of God. <hi>Salomon</hi> confirmes this
where he ſaith, <hi>That the labour of the righteous tendeth to
life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10.16.</note> that is, to a holy and happy
life. A ſincere man is laborious to lead a holy life, to order all his
converſation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the holy rule of Gods Word. That thus this
clauſe is to be interpreted, I collect from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe, which by
way of <hi>antitheſis,</hi> the Wiſe man delivers. <hi>The fruit of the
wicked to ſinne.</hi> The whole proverb <pb n="16" facs="tcp:9267:17"/>put together,
hath the force of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon in it. As the labour of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked tends to
ſinne; ſo the labour of the righteous tends to holineſſe, and ſo
conſequently to happineſſe. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity hath more in it, then an
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding of holineſſe: <hi>Thou art more righteous then I: Thy going in
and out before me in the hoſt is good.</hi> Sincerity hath more in it then a
laſie wiſhing for holineſſe. <hi>O that I might die the death of the
righteous, and that my laſt end might be like his!</hi> Sincerity is ſuch a
ſpeciall worke of God upon the ſoule, that it ſets a man a labouring for
holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Wherefore we labour,</hi> that is, we which are ſincere,
<hi>that whether preſent or abſent, we may be accepted of him.</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. that is, that we may live holily, and die happily; whereas
all other men labour after vanities, and ſo conſequently their labours tend
to ſinne, and ſo to death, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>Sincerity is ſuch a ſpeciall worke of God upon the ſoule,
that it makes a man ſee a tranſcendant worth in the will of God; and worth
begets love, <pb n="17" facs="tcp:9267:17"/>as the Sunne drawes forth the ſpring; and
love begets labour, to attaine the thing beloved. <hi>Thy teſtimonies are
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull: therefore doth my ſoule keepe them, Pſal.</hi> 119.129.
<hi>Thy teſtimonies are wonderfull:</hi> that is, wonderfull righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
juſt, and equall; and wonderfull ſweet; ſweeter then the honey, or the
honey-combe: <hi>therefore doth my ſoule keepe them.</hi> That is, therefore
doth my ſoule labour to keepe them. As if he had ſaid, I ſee ſuch a
tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant purity, and taſte, ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſweetneſſe,
in the teſtimonies of God, that my ſoule cannot chooſe, but labour to
walke in them.</p>
            <p>Sincerity makes a man <hi>[laborious]</hi> to doe the Will of God,
you ſee: that is, it makes a man <hi>conſtantly, willingly,</hi> and
according to <hi>all his ſtrength,</hi> induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. That ſincerity is
ſuch a ſpeciall worke of God upon the ſoule, that makes a man
<hi>[conſtantly)</hi> laborious to doe the Will of God, <hi>Paul</hi> in whom
ſincerity was, confirmes. <hi>And herein doe I exerciſe my ſelfe, to have
[alwaies] a conſcience void of offence, towards God and towards man,
Acts</hi> 24.16. <hi>Pauls</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry <pb n="18" facs="tcp:9267:18"/>was, to obey
the Will of God to day, and the like next day, and ſo he continued laborious
every day, that he might <hi>have [alwaies] a conſcience void of offence,
towards God &amp; man. The high way of the upright, is to depart from
evill,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17. That is, this
is their daily ſoule labour, the continuall road in which they travell, to
get rid of ſinne, and to depart from that more and more. An hypocrite
ſtumbles into this path of piety now &amp; then, but this is not his high
way, his uſuall and daily road; he quickly gets out of it againe: to this
unconſtant cloud, (I conceive] <hi>Salomon</hi> oppoſeth the upright man,
in the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, who makes it a beaten high way, he is ſo conſtant
in his endevours to doe good, and to depart from evill, <hi>I have enclined my
heart, to performe thy ſtatutes [alway] [even unto the end.] Pſal.</hi>
119.112. Sincerity, is ſuch a ſpeciall worke of God upon the ſoule, that
it inclines the heart to labour <hi>alwaies,</hi> to obey the Will of God,
which naturally is quickly weary of wel-doing. As the touch of a Loadſtone,
makes the needle <pb n="19" facs="tcp:9267:18"/>to have a conſtant and reſtleſſe
incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the North: ſo godly ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which I may call Gods
ſecret touch of the heart, it makes the ſoule of man, have a conſtant and
reſtleſſe inclination, to walke in Gods waies; &amp; this conſtant
inclination makes him conſtantly laborious, to doe according to his daily
deſire. Sincerity is ſuch a ſpeciall worke of God upon the ſoule, that
it makes a man to ſet God [al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies] before him, and to doe all things daily
as in his preſence. <hi>I have ſet the Lord [alwaies] before me,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>For we are not as many, which
corrupt the Word of God: but as of ſincerity, but as of God, [in the ſight
of God] ſpeake we in Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. This is the genuine
nature of ſincerity, to make a man to ſet God <hi>[alwaies]</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes, and to doe things, as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him that is
inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sincerity is ſuch a ſpeciall worke of God upon the ſoule,
that it makes a man ſo conſtant in his endeavours to do the Will of God,
that no oppoſition can make him to ceaſe this labour. <hi>The proud have
had me greatly in deriſion: yet <pb n="20" facs="tcp:9267:19"/>have I not declined from
thy Law, Pſal.</hi> 119.51. Proud wretches ſcoff'd at holy waies, and
<hi>Davids</hi> holy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to walke in them: nay, they did this
<hi>vehemently;</hi> and yet <hi>David</hi> (being ſincere) held on his holy
courſe ſtill. Nay, elſe-where he tels us, that they had <hi>almoſt
conſumed him upon earth,</hi> ſuch was their malice againſt him, <hi>and
yet he forſooke not his holy induſtry to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Gods precepts, Pſal.</hi>
119.87. Neither perſecution of tongue nor hand, though never ſo vehement,
can make a man, in whoſe heart godly ſincerity is, to ceaſe his
induſtry to obey God, and walke in his waies. Hang him up as a <hi>bottle in
the ſmoke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 119.83</note> and yet he will not
forget this worke he is about, to wit, to obey Gods ſtatutes. Strong trials
may make a ſincere heart give backe for a time, ſo farre may they prevaile
upon the remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe, that is in the heart of man naturally
when at beſt; but they never prevaile, to make a ſincere heart give off his
labour to obey God.</p>
            <p>That ſincerity is ſuch a ſpeciall <pb n="21" facs="tcp:9267:19"/>worke
of God upon the ſoule, as makes a man <hi>willingly laborious</hi> to doe the
Will of God, is hinted to us by that expreſſion of the Prophet,
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.19. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eate the
good of the Land.</hi> Sincere men, are ſuch as ſhall eate the good of that
holy Land, which <hi>Canaan</hi> typified: So that this being laid downe, as an
unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable concluſion; we ſee that ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſuch a ſpeciall
worke of God upon the ſoule, as toucheth the will, and ſo makes a man not
onely obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but <hi>willing and obedient,</hi> without which there is no
<hi>eating,</hi> that is, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of that holy Land, which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
typified. 'Twas that which God did much looke at, and ſtand upon, under the
old covenant, that in all their ſacrificall ſervices (which were of coſt
and charge) they ſhould be willing and chearfull, or elſe God would not
account their obedience ſincere; and therefore ſaith <hi>David</hi> an
upright man, and that God and all his people might ſee his uprightneſſe,
in this chargeable way of ſerving God, <hi>I will [freely] ſacrifice unto
thee, I will <pb n="22" facs="tcp:9267:20"/>praiſe thy Name, O Lord, for it is good. I
will freely ſacrifice:</hi> that is, willingly, chearfully, bountifully,
&amp;c. If wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe were ſo much lookt at, in their chargeable
ſervices under the old covenant, as a ſymptome of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, much more
doubtleſſe doth God looke at it now, in his ſervices of the new
convenant, which are without expence; and anſwerably doubtleſſe is it
with ſincere men for the generall, under the Goſpell: to wit, more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and chearfull in their ſervices to God, then they under the Law were.</p>
            <p>A ſincere man doth not labour to ſerve God, of conſtraint,
and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, as ſome ſervants, &amp; all beaſts, ſerve us: but
of a ready minde, as one that hath choſen this way of life above all others,
to walke in: <hi>I have choſen the way of truth; thy judgements have I laid
before me. Pſal.</hi> 119.30. Sincerity is ſuch a ſpeciall worke of God
upon the ſoule, that it makes a man ſee a greater beauty in Gods waies,
then in any waies beſide; and to taſte a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſweetneſſe in
theſe waies, then in any waies; and hence the ſoule is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9267:20"/>voluntarily and freely, to <hi>chooſe</hi> theſe waies
to walke in, before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Sincerity is ſuch a ſpeciall work of God
upon the ſoule, that it makes a man ſee the Word of God to be the
ſtraighteſt and trueſt rule of all others, to walke by; and therefore
volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily chooſeth this, before others, to lay before him, as a rule to
walke by. <hi>I have choſen the way [of truth:] thy judgements have I laid
before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſincerity is ſuch a ſpeciall Worke of God upon the
ſoule, as makes a man labourious <hi>[according to all his ſtrength]</hi>
to doe the Will of God, we may lively ſee by ſome notable expreſſions
of <hi>Paul. I preſſe towards the marke, for the price of the high Calling,
of God, in Chriſt Jeſus, Phil.</hi> 3.14.
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, <hi>I purſue, I hunt,</hi>
ſaith the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Purſuing and hunting are actions wherein the

ſets a man to hit the white; and there muſt be all poſſible care in
le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, to doe this. Sincerity ſets the ſoule to winne the priſe;
<hi>(for the price of the high calling)</hi> now a man that <pb n="24" facs="tcp:9267:21"/>would win the priſe, muſt not runne laſily, but he muſt

is ſuch a ſpeciall worke of God upon the ſoule, as makes a man to ſet

labour with all his ſtrength, to walke exactly according to this rule;
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

            <p>Godly ſincerity makes a man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the divine rule, in

deſcribing a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere man, to the Divell, confirmeth this. <hi>And the Lord
ſaid unto Satan, haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant Iob, that there is
none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God
and eſcheweth evill?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 2.3.</note> That is, one that
eyeth all my will, and eſcheweth all that is contrary thereunto. That thus
theſe words are to be interpreted is manifeſt by <hi>Iobs</hi> owne
language, when he would maintaine his ſincerity to God, the ſearcher of all
hearts. <hi>Let me be weighed in an even ballance, that God may know mine
integrity.</hi> Why, what is thy integrity <hi>Iob,</hi> upon which thou doſt
ſo much ſtand? Why 'tis this: I have laboured to obey <hi>all Gods will. If
my ſteps have turned out of the way, and my heart walked after mine eyes, and
if [any blot] hath cleaved to my <pb n="27" facs="tcp:9267:22"/>hand, &amp;c. Iob</hi> 31.
<hi>If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath haſted to deceit;</hi>
and ſo he goes on largely; driving things to this iſſue, that if he had
not beene laborious, to walke according to all Gods will, he would yeeld to
what his adverſaries charged him with, to wit, that his heart was not
ſincere. So likewiſe the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines himſelfe, in deſcribing
<hi>Davids</hi> integrity to <hi>Salomon. And if thou walke before me as David
thy Father, in integrity of heart, and in uprightneſſe, to doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to [all] that I have commanded thee,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.4. By this we
plainely ſee, that ſincerity, ſets a man to doe all that God enjoynes.
Chriſt therefore in the new Teſtament, deſcribing ſincerity to the yong
man that thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as upright (doubtleſſe) as any, <hi>All
theſe things have I kept from any youth:</hi> what lacke I yet? Jeſus
ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect:</hi> that is, if thou wilt be
ſincere and upright indeed, in the eye of God who is a ſearcher of the
heart, <hi>goe and ſell all thou haſt, and give to the poore, and come and
follow me:</hi> Part with every luſt, with covetouſneſſe 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9267:23"/>thy darling ſinne, as well as with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to which thy
nature is not ſo apt, and reſigne up thy heart, to obey me in all things,
ſo ſhalt thou be happy here and hereafter. Sincerity makes a man ſet all
Gods will before him, as a rule to walke by, and to obey God in that part of
his will that moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that ſinne, to which he is moſt enclined,
as well as any other. <hi>For all his judgments were before me; and I did not
put aw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y his ſtatutes from me. I
was upright before him, and kept my ſelfe from [mine iniquity] Pſal.</hi>
18.22.23. <hi>I did not put away his Statutes from me, &amp;c.</hi> An
unſound ſoule will not take notice of ſuch a precept, as oppoſeth his
ſpeciall ſinne: ſuch a precept muſt goe for a blanke, which the ſoule
throwes by, and will not thinke of, but as conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now and then puts him
in minde of it, whether he will or no. But 'tis not ſo with a man in whom
ſincerity is: that precept which doth moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſinne, to which
he is moſt inclined, he labours to obey as well as any other. <hi>J was
upright before thee, and J kept my ſelfe from [mine iniquity.]</hi> 
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:9267:23"/>An unſound ſoule ſets ſo many of Gods ſtatutes
before him, as rules to walke by, as ſuites with himſelfe and the times,
and no more. Such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as oppoſe his ſpeciall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or
diſpleaſe the tunes, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to ſuffering, theſe he
baukes and <hi>puts away,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> here ſaith, and calls them
as the rotten Scribes and Phariſes were wont to doe, <hi>Leaſt
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> ſmall things not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: which rottenneſſe
Chriſt tooke up roundly in thoſe ironicall words, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall
breake one of theſe leaſt Commandements, ſhall be called the leaſt in
the Kingdome of God.</hi> Godly ſincerity makes no difference of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
and leaſt, betweene the precepts of God, but ſets all before a man as a
rule to walke by, and makes the ſoule laborious to obſerve all. <hi>Then
ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto all thy Commandements.
Pſal.</hi> 119.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God may have all the glory due to his Name</hi>] That
ſincerity makes a man to aime at the glory of God, and not at his owne glory,
is manifeſt by that <pb n="30" facs="tcp:9267:24"/>expreſſion the Apoſtle uſeth
in my Text, <hi>not with fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> that is, not declaring our
owne humane parts and gifts, to advance our owne honour and eſteeme, but as
the ſpirit gave us utterance, ſo we ſpeak in all plainneſſe &amp;
ſincereneſſe, that ſo poore ignorant ſoules might be edified, and God
glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Chriſt deſcribing an upright man to the unſound Scribes and
Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, deſcribes him (I remember) by this property, <hi>That he
ſeekes not his owne glory: but his glory that ſent him. He that ſpeaketh
of himſelfe ſeeketh his owne glory: but he that ſeeketh his glory that
ſent him, the ſame is [true,] and no unrighteouſneſſe in him,
Iohn</hi> 7.18. Chriſt that had no guile found in his lips, vindicated his
ſincerity ſtill by this, that he ſought not his own glory in any thing he
did, but the glory of him that ſent him: and that man which doth thus, <hi>he
is true, and there is no unrighteouſneſſe in him.</hi> That is, he is
ſincere, and no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrit as the world may falſly judge. As
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid of a friend, that he is, <hi>alter ego, another
I,</hi> or <hi>another ſelfe:</hi> ſo may I ſay of a Chriſtian, that he
is <hi>alter <pb n="31" facs="tcp:9267:24"/>Chriſtus,</hi> another Chriſt: <hi>as he
is, ſo are we in this world,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> As he aimed in
all things at the glory of his father; ſo a ſincere man aimes in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
in drinking, or whatſoever he does, at the glory of God. <hi>God forbid</hi>
(ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that I ſhould glory in any thing but in
Chriſt.</hi> Sincerity is ſuch a ſpeciall worke of God upon the ſoule,
that it makes a man give Chriſt all the glory, of all the good he does, and
of all the good he has, and hopes for; and to appropriate nothing to himſelfe
but ſhame, <hi>yet am I nothing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> Nothing but a
ſinner; nay, of all ſinners the chiefe.</p>
            <p>An upright man, <hi>is a man after Gods owne heart:</hi> now looke
what God moſt lookes for, that an upright man lookes moſt at, and labours
moſt of all to helpe God unto. Now God lookes at his owne honour and glory in
every thing, wherein he hath to doe with the creature, above any thing. He made
all things for his glory; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all things for his glory. There ſhould
never have beene a ſtone laid, in the glorious Fabricke of this world, 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9267:25"/>had it not beene for Gods glory: nor not a ſtone ſhould
have beene left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtone, long ere this, but the whole world ſhould
have beene turned into his firſt nothing, were it not for Gods glory. This a
ſincere man eyes, and anſwerably applies himſelfe to God in all he does;
as an obedient wife ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies her ſelfe to that ſweet carriage, that ſhe
knowes will moſt delight her husband. When <hi>Iſaac</hi> had diſcovered
to <hi>Eſau,</hi> that Veniſon was the moſt ſavory meat, which his
ſoule deſired, <hi>Eſau</hi> applied himſelfe to his father, and goes a
hunting after it, that he might bring to his father what he moſt loved, and
ſo obtaine his fathers bleſſing. Now God hath declared that his honour
and glory is that ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meat which his ſoule of all things, moſt
loves; and therefore all that are ſincere children of God, they doe hunt and
plot for this, in all their waies that they may bring God that ſavourie
meate, which his ſoule moſt loves.</p>
            <p>The deſcription of ſincerity being thus opened, I am in the
next place to ſhew unto you, the grounds of the <pb n="33" facs="tcp:9267:25"/>point;
why we ought thus ſimply and ſincerely, to have our converſation in this
world. The grounds are theſe foure: Firſt, becauſe God commands it.
Secondly, becauſe God delights in it. Thirdly, becauſe God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
this and no other way unto all good. Laſtly, becauſe the world which lies
in wickedneſſe, may be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe. Firſt, we ought in
ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and godly ſincerity, to have our converſation in the world,
becauſe God commands it. <hi>I am the Almighty God, walke before me, and be
thou perfect;</hi> that is, <hi>entire, ſincere, Gen.</hi> 17.1. This
Commandement God gave to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and in him to all us. This
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is not grievous; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that hath any injuſtice in it,
that any ſhould complaine or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt it, and therefore ought to be
obeyed. For God made man, and can unmake him againe at his pleaſure; and
therefore may juſtly ſerve himſelfe of him, and appoint him wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> rules he pleaſeth to walke by. <hi>I
am God Almighty] walke before me and be ſincere.</hi> I by my Almighty power 
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9267:26"/>made thee of nothing, and can quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this Almighty
power, turne thee into worſe then nothing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore walke thus and thus as
I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee.</p>
            <p>God did more by his Almighty power, then barely make man: God by
his Almighty power made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: that is, not as uprightneſſe notes
ſincerity, but as uprightneſſe notes perfection. And therefore God might
juſtly command us (if he would) to walke perfectly, as Angels and Saints in
Heaven doe. This Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore is not grievous, but full of mercy and
moderation, that he commands us only to walke before him and be upright, as
uprightneſſe notes ſincerity. Therefore ſeeing 'tis a Commandement full
of juſtice and mercy both, it ought to be obeyed: and ſo conſequently,
every one of us ought in ſimplicity and godly ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to have our
converſation in this world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as God commands us to be ſincere, ſo he
<hi>delights</hi> in it; and therefore we ought in ſimplicity and 
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9267:26"/>godly ſincerity, to have our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in this
World. <hi>They that are of a froward heart, are an abomination to the Lord;
but ſuch as are upright in their way, are his delight. Prov.</hi> 11.20.
Kings, as they have officers for neceſſity, ſo they have favorites,
perſons of honour for communion and delight. Now the King of Kings, would
have no fit perſons of honour, for communion and delight in this world, were
there no upright men, in it: and therefore we ought in ſimplicity and godly
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, to have our converſation in this world. God would live
ſolitary and alone in this world, without any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or delight in this
world, were there no upright men, nor upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it: for God hath no
pleaſure in wickedneſſe nor wicked men. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath
pleaſure in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 5.4. The God of this world, that
rules in the children of diſobedience, is a God that hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in
wickedneſſe; but the God of all the world, is not ſuch a God; he hath
pleaſure onely in uprightneſſe. <hi>I know alſo my God, that thou
trieſt the <pb n="36" facs="tcp:9267:27"/>heart, and haſt pleaſure in
uprightneſſe.</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.17. And therefore we ought to walke
in uprightneſſe, or elſe we ſhall deprive the King of Kings, of his
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ought in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, to have
our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in this world, becauſe God hath appointed this and no
other way to all good. <hi>For the Lord God is a Sunne and a Shield; the Lord
will give grace and glory; no good thing will he with-hold, from them that
walke uprightly. Pſal.</hi> 84.11. If we would have the light of Gods
ſmiling countenance, to ſhine upon our ſoules, which is ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times more glorious, and reviving then the Sunne, we muſt walke
<hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly:</hi> for the Lord God is a <hi>Sunne</hi> to ſuch, and to
none elſe. God <hi>is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> ſaith the
Prophet: and being angry with them every day, he cannot ſmile upon their
ſoules, as the Sunne doth upon all creatures, but frowne and knit the browes
againſt them. God dwels as a convincer and reprover, and not as a comforter,
in the hearts of hypocrits. God feeds <pb n="37" facs="tcp:9267:27"/>mens ſoules with
gall and worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, with bitters, not with ſweets; with <hi>a certaine
fearefull looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation,</hi> which have not
their converſation in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and godly ſincerity, in this world A
Hell and not a Heaven, ſhall men that walke not uprightly, have within their
owne hearts.</p>
            <p>If we would have protection, we muſt walke uprightly: for the
Lord God is a <hi>Shield</hi> onely to ſuch. <hi>He that walketh
righteouſly and ſpeaketh uprightly, his place of defence ſhall be the
munitions of Rocks, Iſa.</hi> 33.15. God is a conſuming fire, and not a
defence unto the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit. In a word, if a man would have grace or glory, or
any good thing elſe that he can name, he muſt walke in this way to obtaine
it, to wit, <hi>in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and godly ſincerity:</hi> for in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way hath God engaged himſelfe, to beſtow any good upon man, but all evill.
The Iſraelites going out on the Sabbath day to finde Manna, found nothing but
a curſe; and the reaſon, becauſe out of Gods way. God will diſtribute
bleſſings in his owne way: <pb n="38" facs="tcp:9267:28"/>if we decline this way, God
will inflict curſes, and not bleſſings. Now upright walking is that way,
in which God hath promiſed to beſtow all good, and none elſe: and
therefore we ought thus to walke. 'Tis fit we ſhould come to God, and not God
to us: 'tis fit that unholy man ſhould conforme to a holy God; and not a holy
God, to unholy man.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1</note>Finally, we ought <hi>in ſimplicity
and godly ſincerity, to have our converſation in the World,</hi> that ſo
the world which lies in wickedneſſe, may be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, both in
regard of their wickedneſſe towards God, and his children. Wicked men
complaine of Chriſt, that he is a hard maſter, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to reape where he
did not ſow; that this and that precept is a hard ſaying, none can obey it.
And others complaine that the world is ſo full of occaſions and
provocations, that 'tis impoſſible to walke uprightly. Others, that times
are ſo hard and dead, that they cannot live of their callings, if they
ſhould deale juſtly, and walke uprightly. Now Chriſt will ſtop the 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9267:28"/>mouthes of all theſe at the great day, by ſetting
before them thoſe that have lived, in the ſame ages of the world, in the
ſame employments in the world, under the ſame government of Chriſt in the
world, and yet have kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unſpotted of the world, and have in
ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, had their converſation in the world: and
then ſhall Chriſt <hi>be cleare when he judges,</hi> and liars mouthes
ſhall be ſtopt, and be like the man that wanted a wedding garment. And
therefore we ought in ſimplicity and godly ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to have our
converſation in the world, every one in his place, that ſo Chriſt may doe
this ſervice by us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked, at the great day.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2</note>Againe, that wicked men may be left
without excuſe, as in regard of their wickedneſſe towards God, ſo in
regard of their wickedneſſe towards Gods children. Now the wicked
perſecute the godly with tongue and hand, and pretend juſt ground for their
practice; that the godly are, as he falſely ſaid of the Prophet, troublers
of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> enemies to Church and State. But at <pb n="40" facs="tcp:9267:29"/>the great day, the ſearcher of all hearts will lay open all things
according to truth; and make it plainely appeare to men and Angels, that they
had their converſation in this world, in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity,
and ſo guiltleſſe of all, that the wicked accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them of, and
puniſhed them for; and then will Chriſt be cleare when he judges theſe
wretches, for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the generation of the juſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to
walke ſincerely and blameleſſely in this world, that ſo the wicked may
have no plea, for their wicked proceedings againſt us, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the
righteous proceeding of Chriſt, againſt them.</p>
            <p>Ought we <hi>in ſimplicity and godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, to have our
converſation in the world?</hi> Why, then let us examine our ſelves, and
ſee whether we thus walke. Are ye <hi>laborious?</hi> that is,
<hi>conſtantly</hi> laborious, <hi>willingly</hi> laborious; labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>according to all your ſtrength,</hi> to doe <hi>all Gods will,</hi> that
<hi>he may have all the glory due to his Name?</hi> Looke backe, and call to
minde, how this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſincerity was opened, and lay 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9267:29"/>open your hearts and lives by it, and ſee whether they
agree or not. Are ye <hi>laborious</hi> to doe the will of God? Or doe ye not
the <hi>worke of the Lord negligently?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier.
48.10.</note> and ſo ſtand lyable to that dreadfull curſe denounced by
<hi>Ieremy?</hi> Doe ye not reſt in bodily exerciſes, which profit nothing?
'Tis the leaſt labour in the world, to bring the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man to duties; the
labour of labours is about the heart, to bring that to duties; are ye laborious
about this? Are ye watchfull over your Spirits, and laborious about your inward
man, that this in every thing, may goe along with the outward man to obey God.
'Twas that the Lord of old upbraided his people withall, that they were
laborious according to the outward man, to come to Church, and to be at all
divine exerciſes, but they were careleſſe reſpecting their hearts,
which God moſt lookt at, and let this runne looſe after vanity. <hi>And
they come unto thee, as thy people commeth, and they ſit before thee as thy
people, and they heare thy words, but they will not doe them: for with their
mouthes they ſhew much love, <pb n="42" facs="tcp:9267:30"/>but their heart goeth after
their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Ezek.</hi> 33.31. God moſt lookes at the heart,
how that is entire to, or looſe from, himſelfe. Are ye moſt laborious
about that, which God moſt lookes at? or doe ye not leaſt minde that which
God lookes at moſt? In this conſiſts the power of godlineſſe, to be
laborious about the inward man, to bring this to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the will of
God <hi>(My Sonne, give me thy heart.)</hi> Neglect this, and thou wert as good
ſit ſtill, as labour at all about thy outward man, to bring that to be
holy: thy labour about out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide holineſſe, is to God as the cutting off
of a dogs necke: and God will upbraid thy labour, as he did thoſe
hypocriticall Scribes and Phariſees, who <hi>waſhed the out-ſide of the
Cup and Platter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poſſibly ſome of you may thinke, that you hold weight well
enough by this: That you are <hi>laborious</hi> according to the outward man,
and according to the inward man, to doe the will of God: but put in one weight
more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scales and Ballance of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, <pb n="43" facs="tcp:9267:30"/>to
wit, this; Are ye <hi>conſtantly</hi> laborious to doe the will of God? Tell
me which way the Scales turne now. Sincerity makes a man <hi>conſtantly</hi>
labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to doe the will of God, as you have largely heard; doe you thus
labour? Or are ye not quickly weary in wel-doing; ſo weary as to leave off
the worke? Thou art watchfull over thy ſpirit to day; but art thou not as
careleſſe about it to morrow? The godly are ſubject to
weariſomeneſſe, and <hi>fainting in their minds</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
intimates) in their labouring about, and watching with an unruly heart; but
they are never ſo weary, as to give over the worke. <hi>David</hi> was
<hi>wearied</hi> often with his <hi>groanings,</hi> they were ſo deepe, and
breathed out ſo many precious Spirits; but yet as freſh ſtrength came, he
kept on groaning ſtill, under the heavie burthen of a bad heart, and never
left labouring about his ſpirit, to bring it to be more and more compoſed,
entire, and one with God as long as he lived. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Chriſtians, are
quickly weary in labouring about their hearts, juſt in <pb n="44" facs="tcp:9267:31"/>that ſenſe, which God is ſaid to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of repenting,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me</hi> (ſaith the Lord)
<hi>thou art gone backeward; therefore will I ſtretch out my hand againſt
thee, I am weary of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> That is, I will repent no more: I will
forbeare the execution of my threatnings no longer. So rotten hearts are
wearied with repenting, ſoule ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and ſoule watching, that they
will repent no more, nor maintaine inward induſtry about their ſoules no
more; but judge of it upon a little tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as that which will ſhorten their
lives, or at leaſt, utterly end the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their lives, and at laſt
cry it downe, as an unneceſſary and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice. Is it not
thus with you?</p>
            <p>Poſſibly yet ſome of you may think, that you hold weight
well enough, by the Ballance of the Sanctuary. But put in one weight more, and
tell me which way the ſcales turne then. Are ye <hi>willingly and cheerefully
laborious,</hi> to doe the will of God? Doe you finde any ſoule
ſweetneſſe, in your ſoule la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Or are they not as the diſeaſe 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9267:31"/>of the ſtone, ſtrong tortures, without the leaſt tang
of ſweetneſſe? Is it not as death unto thee, to be ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
humbling, watching and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving thy ſpirit, a day? Doeſt thou not
ſhunne and avoid occaſions, as much as thou canſt, that may make thee to
looke in upon thy ſpirit, to checke it in its vaine way, as that which is
like the pricking of thy <hi>right eye?</hi> Doeſt thou not make frivolous
excuſes, and needleſſe buſineſſe, to put by <hi>Davids</hi>
opportunities, of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate commerce with God and thine owne ſoule? as one
that findeth no pleaſure nor profit, in this ſervice of God? Doeſt thou
not wiſh that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were over, Sermons over, the Lords day over, that thou
mighteſt be ſelling Corne, and following thy ſecular employments, and
carnall ſports and delights, as thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou findeſt more ſoule
content, then in any divine thing. <hi>'Tis a joy to the juſt to doe
judgement,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Tis the ſweeteſt pleaſure in
the world to an upright man, to be in upright holy waies, doing uprightly to
God <pb n="46" facs="tcp:9267:32"/>and man. Gods word, Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Gods people, Gods
ſervice in every part thereof, are all tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſweet to an
upright ſoule: <hi>Sweeter then honey,</hi> that is, ſweeter then the
ſweeteſt earthly content. And the more ſpirituall divine duties and
exerciſes are, the more pleaſing and taking ſtill, to an upright ſoule.
Duties of moſt ſeriouſneſſe and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are of moſt

            <p>Poſſibly yet ſome of you may thinke that you hold weight
well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, by this Ballance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie. But put in one graine more,
and tell me whether thou be not found too light then? Are ye laborious
<hi>according to all your ſtrength,</hi> to doe the will of God? Doe you
<hi>reach forth</hi> and <hi>preſſe forward,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith? that is, put out all your ſtrength to obey the will of God? this in
Scripture, where ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is preſſed unto, is called a ſerving of God
with <hi>all our hearts.</hi> You take a little pains to obey the will of God,
but could you not take a great deale more if you liſted? 'Twas the
unſoundneſſe <pb n="47" facs="tcp:9267:32"/>of the Jewes, that when they could have
brought Males and legiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

ſacrifices, they brought (to ſave their purſes) maimed and deformed
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. And ſo 'twas the unſoundneſſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> that he
could have killed <hi>Agag</hi> and the fat of the Cattell, as well as the
reſt of the Amalekits, if he would. And is it not your hypocriſie, that you
could doe a great deale more to pleaſe God, then you doe, if you liſted?
Doe not by and ſelfe ends make you pluck in your hornes, and ſuſpend your
ſelves, parts and abilities from God ſervice? Doth not the feare of the
loſſe of your liberties, livings, lives, and the like, make you ſpeake
leſſe for God, and doe leſſe for God, then he hath given you ability
and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to doe? Doe ye not put forth your parts in the ſervice of
God, in reference to the ſafety of your skin, and not in reference to Gods
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which calls for all our might, in his ſervice?</p>
            <p>If you tell me that you hold weight yet by the ballance of the
ſanctuary, why put in yet one graine more, and <pb n="48" facs="tcp:9267:33"/>tell me
whether the skales do not ſtand without poiſing either way? Are ye
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious according to all your ſtrength, <hi>to doe all Gods will?</hi>
according to that holy rule, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Onely if thou care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve to doe [all theſe
Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements] which I command thee this day.</hi> You doe with
<hi>Herod,</hi> by meanes of powerfull preaching, and ſharpe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
reforme <hi>many things</hi> perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, but doe ye labour to reforme all
things? To divorce your ſelves from your <hi>Herodias?</hi> To pull out right
eyes, and to cut off right hands? To morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your <hi>members which are upon
earth;</hi> that is, the ſinnes of your ſoules, which are as deare unto you
as the members of your bodies? or doe ye not ſpare <hi>Agag,</hi> and the fat
of your luſts? plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſinnes, and profitable ſinnes? Doe you
obſerve doctrine and diſcipline, matter and manner in the worſhip and
ſervice of God?</p>
            <p>You pray, but doe ye pray <hi>fervently?</hi> You pray, but doe ye
<hi>watch and pray?</hi> You heare the word of God, but doe ye <hi>take heed
how ye heare?</hi> You receive <pb n="49" facs="tcp:9267:33"/>the Sacrament, but doe ye
<hi>examine you ſelves and ſo eate?</hi> You goe to the houſe of God
about holy duties, but do ye <hi>look to your feet,</hi> when you approach ſo
neere unto God? you give to the poore, but do you give <hi>chearfully?</hi> You
give, but do you give liberally? You know the Scripture calls for manner, as
well as matter: man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is all in all with God. And ſincerity is ſuch a
ſpeciall work of God upon the ſoule, that it makes a man laborious to do
every divine thing exact, according to that divine manner, which God in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> word preſcribes. 'Tis not thus with
an hypocrite: he is lead by cuſtomes; and makes it a matter of conſcience,
not to ſwerve from theſe, how incongruous ſo ever to the word of God; Or
elſ he is fearefully given over to a careleſs Spirit, to doe divine things
as hits, he cares not how; any way, or no way, all is one. Or elſe, he is
deſperatly pinned to his owne will, being wiſer in his owne eyes then ten
men that give a reaſon. Thus &amp; thus he will walke, ſay all the world
what they will: is it not thus with you?</p>
            <p>If you tell me that yet you hold out weight by the ballance of the
ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I am glad; yet poſſibly you may <pb n="50" facs="tcp:9267:34"/>be one
graine too light. Are ye labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to doe all Gods will, <hi>that God may have
all the glory due to his name?</hi> Do ye not ſacrifice to your owne ners,
and take the glory to your ſelves of your labours like <hi>Herod?</hi> When
men applaud you, is not this to you, as the rubbing of a Parrat upon the head,
very pleaſing, and that which makes you hugge your ſelves within your owne
thoughts: <hi>Is not this great Babell which I have built?</hi> Could ſuch a
thing have beene done, if I had not done it? Or could any man have done it ſo
well as I? Looke in upon your ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but ſpecially after divine
duties, and ſee whether you doe not ſeeke your ſelves in them, more then
the glory of Chriſt. Doe ye not give almes to be accounted liberall men, and
that the poore may applaud you for good men, and good houſe-keepers? Doe ye
not <hi>blow a Trumpet, when you give almes?</hi> that is, ſo diſtribute
your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as may be moſt advantagious to your owne repute in the world?
Do ye not let your left hand know ſtill what your right hand doth? Are ye not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9267:34"/>dampt in your deſignes of charity and bounty, when 'tis
to goe forth in ſuch a way, as if it were <hi>caſt upon waters,</hi> or
into the bottome of a Well, where no eye can ſee, nor no tongue ſpeake of
your good workes, nor no likely'ud of the leaſt returne? Doe ye not looke for
much obſervance, from ſuch to whom you doe much? And repent of your
kindneſſe, when men doe not anſwere it in thankfulneſſe? Doe ye eye
Chriſts command, and out of love to him, give upon all juſt occaſions, as
unto him? Are thoſe that are religious tendered and ſuccoured by you, in
their bonds and miſeries, <hi>as if you were bound with them,</hi> according
to the divine rule?</p>
            <p>Doe ye not in prayer, more looke at words and expreſſions,
then to your ſpirits? Doe ye not <hi>pray in the market-places?</hi> That is,
ſo pray that others may obſerve you, and blaze abroad that you are very
devout perſons? Are ye not induſtrious to pray well (as you call it) in
publike, and careleſſe and perfunctory, when you pray in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate? Are ye
not more conſtant a great <pb n="52" facs="tcp:9267:35"/>deale, in the performance of
publike, then in the performance of private prayers, where there is no
obſerver nor applauder but God, which ſees and heares in ſecret? Doe ye
not after prayer, hug your owne gifts, and admire your apt expreſſions,
dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of utterance; and to thinke much, that you have no more thankes
given you for your paines; and that thoſe that joyned with you, were no more
affected? Doe ye not pin your ſpirits to your owne acute ſtudied formes,
and praiers in print, <hi>boaſting of things made ready to your hand,</hi>
(as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) and ſcoffe at the <hi>ſpirit of grace and
ſupplication, Zech.</hi> 12.10.</p>
            <p>Doe ye not preach your ſelves and not Chriſt; and more looke
at words then matter; to pleaſe men, then to pleaſe God? Doe ye labour to
approve your ſelves to every mans conſcience, or to every mans fancie? Doe
ye not put plaine truths, into abſtruſe termes, a new coat upon old
divinitie, and ſtrive to ſoare in drie Metaphyſicall ſtraines, above
your owne and others apprehenſion? Doe ye not <hi>build hay 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9267:35"/>and ſtubble,</hi> upon the true foundation? the opinions
of Fathers and Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the tenents of proud time-ſervers, whom God
hath given over to a <hi>Spirit of deluſion to believe lies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they
received not the truth in the love of it?</hi> Doe ye aime at conviction,
converſion, or oſtentation in your preaching? Doth it not almoſt make you
ſicke like <hi>Ahab,</hi> that your cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Sermons in places of eminent
note, have not yet brought you to a fat living? Doe ye not preach <hi>Chriſt
out of envie,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, to bring about your wicked
deſignes, and to vend your malicious ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the godly? Doe ye
not wreſt the word of Chriſt, to confirme your time-ſerving tenents,
&amp; to maintaine your voluptuous loitering life? And if ſo: is this <hi>in
ſimplicity and godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to have your converſation in the
world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To you that by what hath beene ſaid, ſee, that you are yet
unſound at heart, that you doe not in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity,
order your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in this world, I have three <pb n="54" facs="tcp:9267:36"/>things to ſay: Labour to be affected with your unſoundneſſe:
Then judge your ſelves, that you may never be judged of the Lord: And then
begge the cure of your foule diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, labour to be affected with your unſoundneſſe. This
is the killing miſchiefe of hypocriſie, that it is hard and difficult,
throughly to be found out, and truely to be bewailed. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie is
<hi>vitium latens, vitium tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurans, vitium adulans, &amp; vitium
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durans:</hi> a hidden, a transforming, a flattering, and a hardening vice. 
<note place="margin">1</note> 'Tis a hidden vice. <hi>The heart is
deceitfull, and deſperately wicked, who can [know it]</hi> (ſaith the
Prophet.) <hi>The ſpirit of a man may know the things of a man;</hi> but
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and guile, this lurkes and skulkes in ſuch hidden corners of the
heart, that the ſpirit of man does not know it. And hence it is, that
multitudes thinke themſelves very ſincere, which yet are very unſound. A
man may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, and whoring in himſelfe,
and yet all this while, be utterly unable to ſee the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie of his
ſpirit: and hence 'tis, <pb n="55" facs="tcp:9267:36"/>that you ſhall have drunkards,
ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and whore-maſters to confeſſe theſe vices, and yet plead
for the goodneſſe of their hearts and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings too.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2</note>When the unſoundneſſe of the
heart, is diſcovered by the word and ſpirit of God then hypocriſie
becomes <hi>vitium transfigurans,</hi> a transforming vice. The heart ſtrives
now, to put faire gloſſes upon foule matters; to put a beautifull vizzard,
upon the uglie face of ſinne; and to appeare in the eye of awakened
conſcience, quite of another colour; or at leaſt nothing ſo uglie, as the
word of God would make it to be.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3</note>If this will not ſtop the mouth of
complaining conſcience, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>vitium adulans,</hi> a
flattering vice. The heart tells conſcience now, that 'tis true, things are
bad, but God is very good: he is not <hi>extreame to marke what is done
amiſſe;</hi> a thouſand worſe perſons have found mercy, and are gone
to Heaven, and therefore thou needſt not ſo much trouble thy ſelfe O my
ſoule. <hi>He that beleeves makes not <pb n="56" facs="tcp:9267:37"/>haſt;</hi> 'tis
time enough yet, to amend all that is amiſſe, and to be as good as the
beſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4</note>All this while that it is a <hi>hidden
vice, a transforming vice, a flattering vice,</hi> 'tis <hi>a hardning
vice.</hi> All the while hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie lies hid, and after it is diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ſhifts and flatters, it inſenſibly hardens; ſo that whilſt
<hi>deceiving,</hi> the ſoule is miſerably deceived, and then becomes
<hi>paſt feeling,</hi> conſcience being <hi>ſeared with an hot iron:</hi>
that is, God utterly leaving conſcience, to doe any office any longer for
him, in checking ſuch a ſhifting ſhuffling ſinner, in his ſinfull
way. And when this worke is done upon any ſoule, you may leave tolling, and
ring out; for he is dead and gone for ever.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe hypocriſie is of ſuch a ſhuffling ſubtile
nature as this, 'tis very hard for a man to become truely ſenſible of it,
and throughly affected with it: and therefore I exhort you, which are convinced
by what was formerly delivered, of your unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, firſt to labour
to be truely ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, and deepely affected with it. 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9267:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>'Tis a vice that of all vices, puts you into the
furtheſt unlikeneſſe to God, and the neereſt likeneſſe to the
divell. It puts you into the furtheſt diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God, of all
vices: for God is <hi>moſt upright,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſaiah. Thou [moſt
upright] doeſt weigh the path of the juſt. Iſai.</hi> 26.7. God is
<hi>moſt upright,</hi> and an hypocrit of all men leaſt upright: and
therefore, an hypocrite of all men, is leaſt like God, and yet moſt like
the divell; of whom I may ſay, as the Lord of the Leviathan, <hi>He is
King,</hi> faith God, <hi>of all the children of pride:</hi> So is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
King of all the children of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. As 'tis ſaid of God, that he is
<hi>moſt upright;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of the divell, that he is moſt
guilefull; an arch hypocrit: and therefore guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſons are moſt like
the divell; and the more guilefull, the more like: and hence is
<hi>Elimas,</hi> who was <hi>full of all ſubtilty,</hi> by way of eminencie,
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>child of the divell</hi> by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who knew well
how aptly to ſtile hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits.</p>
            <p>'Tis a vice that turnes man into a divell, and God into fury
fiercer then <pb n="58" facs="tcp:9267:38"/>the divell: for the divell is but Gods
creature, and therefore though his fury be unexpreſſible by us, yet it is
finite in it ſelfe; but Gods fury againſt hypocrits is infinite; and
therefore you ſhall finde him ſpending a whole chapter, in breathing out
woes againſt hypocrits; and therefore hell as the moſt ſuitable place,
and the greateſt torments in hell, as the moſt ſuitable thing to an
infinit fury, is reſerved as a peculiar portion for hypocrits. Were
infinitneſſe communicable, and by a finite creature ſuſceptible, no
leſſe then infinite fury, ſhould hypocrits burne in.</p>
            <p>When thou haſt by ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe, brought
thy ſpirit to be truely affected with thy unſoundneſſe, then judge thy
ſelfe for it, that thou maiſt not be judged of the Lord. Judge thy ſelfe
as one moſt injurious to Chriſt and his glory, of all men. Judge thy
ſelfe as a Traitour to the King of Kings: as one that haſt craftily
conſpired, with the divell and thine owne heart, to keepe out Chriſt from
ruling and raigning in thee: as one <pb n="59" facs="tcp:9267:38"/>that haſt ſubtily
betrayed the honour of God, in every action thou haſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ſeeking
thy ſelfe under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſeeking him. Judge thy ſelfe as a cheater,
that haſt beene cunning to deceive the godly, and thine owne poore ſoule.
Judge thy ſelfe, as a ſelfe-ſoule-murtherer, that haſt craftily baffled
thine owne conſcience, that Gods word might not convert and turne thee, from
thine ungodly courſe, and ſo ſave thy precious ſoule. Judge thy ſelfe
as a <hi>Iudas,</hi> that kiſſeſt Chriſt, boweſt and cringeſt to
Chriſt, and yet betraieſt and crucifieſt Chriſt. In a word, judge thy
ſelfe as a right hand of the divell, by which he hath done a great deale of
miſchiefe: judge thy ſelfe as a capitall offender, as a ſinner of all
ſinners the chiefe; and then beg pardon.</p>
            <p>And intreat God to cure the foule diſeaſe of thy heart. Tell
him how long this diſeaſe hath beene upon thee; and what a loathſome
creature 'tath made thee; and what a prime vitall part 'tis faſtened upon;
and how neere peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing thou art; and how 'tis paſt the 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9267:39"/>cure of all other Phyſicions and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that
there is but one way with thee ſpeedily, if thou haſt not remedy forthwith
from him; and that thou haſt nothing of thine owne, to ſatisfie him for the
cure of it; but haſt a friend Chriſt, that will pay all. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, to
begge him, who <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioneth all mens hearts alike,</hi> to mend thy bad
heart with a new one, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe. Onely a new heart, is an
upright heart; and this God hath promiſed to give, and this thou muſt urge,
and believe, and waite: and this way ſhalt thou be healed, helped and
ſaved.</p>
            <p>To you which upon examination finde, that you do <hi>in
ſimplicity and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincerity, order your converſation in this
world,</hi> I have onely this to ſay, you doe no more then you ought, and
therefore there is no place for boaſting. 'Tis our beauty in Gods eye, to be
vile in our owne eyes, what ever our parts and endeavours be. Thy
uprightneſſe of integrity, comes farre ſhort of that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of
perfection, in which thou waſt created: and therefore when thou 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9267:39"/>haſt done all that thou canſt, yet <hi>ſay that thou
art an unprofitable ſervant;</hi> a man that comes farre ſhort of what thou
ſhouldſt be, and of what once thou waſt.</p>
            <p>But that which I would rather ſtand on a little, is this, Thou
that walkeſt ſincerely, doeſt no more then thou oughtſt, and therefore
goe on. The Apoſtles exhortation to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> ſhall be mine to
you: <hi>Looke diligently leaſt any man faile of the grace of God, leaſt
any root of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>terneſſe
ſpringing up, trouble you, and thereby many be defiled. Heb.</hi> 12.15. We
have that within us, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, which will corrupt our
ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and turne us aſide from our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere converſation, if we
doe not watch over our ſelves. 
<note place="margin">1</note> Where ſimplicity is, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie is
not wholly extir pated; ſome remainders of this foule evill are in the beſt
heart; and theſe rootes of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if you be not ſtill labouring
to grub up, they will quickly over-grow ſincerity, and all good in the
heart.</p>
            <p>And as we have that within us, which will quickly ſeduce us,
from that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is in Chriſt; ſo we have that 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9267:40"/>without us too, which will do the like, if we be not very
watchfull, to wit the divell and his children. The divell is an arch Apoſtate
himſelfe, and he labours might and maine, to make all the ſons of men, to
fall from grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as he hath done; that ſo every one, may be
as neere like himſelfe, in ſinne and miſery, as may be. <hi>He goes about
like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devoure</hi> (ſaith the
Apoſtle.) A thouſand wiles hath the Divell to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our ſimplicity;
and he is more laborious about this, then about any deſigne againſt the
ſoule of man. The divell is not ſo laborious, to make a breach upon a mans
faith or patience, or the like, as upon a mans ſincerity: becauſe he knowes
that every breach made upon this, is a ſtab to the heart, which wil kill the
ſoule for ever, if God do not admirably cure it. If labour will accompliſh
this deſigne, the divell will not neglect that: <hi>he goes about ſeeking
whom he may devoure.</hi> If terrours and affrightments will accompliſh this
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, the Divell <hi>will roare like a Lyon,</hi> againſt a mans
ſoule, as if he would <pb n="63" facs="tcp:9267:40"/>teare him to pieces, and ſuddenly
throw him into that bottomeleſſe pit, without all redemption. If flattery
will be more prevalent then terrour, to bring about this deſigne, the divell
will <hi>transforme himſelfe into an Angell of light,</hi> and promiſe us
<hi>all the Kingdomes of the World,</hi> to winde us about to him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2</note>And as the divell is laborious about
this deſigne, ſo he hath many Apoſtate children, ſuch as have
<hi>loſt that good that they ſeemed to have,</hi> and theſe, as their

la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour tooth and naile, not onely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively by example, but actively by

of faith and a good conſcience, and are gone in the way of <hi>Balaam</hi>
the ſonne of <hi>Boſor</hi> that arch hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrit, ſtudying and labouring
to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve Gods people, for preferments and honours in the world;
<hi>ſpeaking lies <pb n="64" facs="tcp:9267:41"/>in hypocriſie, having their
conſciences ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with an hot iron.</hi> And therefore 'tis but needfull
and ſeaſonable, that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to looke to your ſpirits, and take
heed of theſe bitter rootes, that ye be not defiled by them. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what
God ſaith by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel. When the righteous man turneth away
from his righteouſneſſe which he hath done, and committeth iniquity, all
the righteouſneſſe which he hath done, ſhall not be mentioned, but in
his treſpaſſe which he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſinne which he
hath ſinned, in that ſhall he die. Ezek.</hi> 18.24. And if once you wax
weary of well doing, and decline ſincere wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, all thy former integrity
ſhall not ſo much as once be mentioned to thy comfort, but to thy terrour
often ſhall it be by way of upbraiding, mentioned to thy conſcience here,
and to the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of thy condemnation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as one that haſt
taſted of the powers of the world to come, of the ſweetneſſe of the
ſpirit of grace, and yet after this, haſt grieved, oppoſed, and done
deſpight againſt it.</p>
            <p>Having therefore put your hand to <pb n="65" facs="tcp:9267:41"/>the plough,
looke not backe: having begun in the ſpirit, doe not end in the fleſh:
having begun to order your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſincerely and uprightly, ſo
continue unto the death, what ever you undergoe in life All afflictions for
righteouſneſſe ſake, ſhall be tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, comfortable, and at laſt

who will with the temptation ſhew a way to eſcape.</hi>

propoſition now in order to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is this, <hi>That conſcience can
give teſtimony, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſimplicity or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, of a mans
converſation Pauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience gave teſtimony with him, that in
ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, he had behaved himſelfe, in preaching and
living, in life and doctrine, as a faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt ought to 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9267:43"/>doe. So likewiſe his conſcience bore witneſſe with
him, concerning his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and holy deſires, towards his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and
kinſmen according to the fleſh. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lie
not, my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt, that I
have great heavineſſe, and continuall ſorrow in my heart; for I could
wiſh my ſelfe were accurſed from Chriſt, for my brethren, my kinſmen
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh. Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Iobs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo
gave teſtimony concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his integrity. <hi>Let me be weighed in an even
ballance, that God may know mine integrity.</hi> By this and many ſuch like
expreſſions of his, 'tis moſt plaine, that his conſcience could give
teſtimony concerning his converſation, what it was, whether good or bad.
<hi>Davids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did the like. <hi>Thou O Lord ſhalt judge the
people: judge me O Lord, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my righteouſneſſe, &amp; according
to mine integrity that is in me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 7.8.</note> A
large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of particulars to this purpoſe, might eaſily be made, but
I rather take another way, to confirme this point.</p>
            <p>The truth of this point (I conceive) will be better confirmed and
opened, <pb n="69" facs="tcp:9267:43"/>by ſetting before you what conſcience is; and
then you will plainely ſee what conſcience can doe, and doth doe, in the
ſoule of man. Conſcience is better felt then defined, for ought that I can
yet finde, among the learned. <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a part of the
underſtanding, in all reaſonable creatures, determining of their particular
actions, either with them or againſt them,</hi> ſay ſome.
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a reflection of the ſoule upon it ſelfe,</hi> ſay
others. <hi>Conſcience</hi> (ſay I) <hi>is a naturall power which the
ſoule of man hath, above all unreaſonable creatures, to compare his waies
by ſome rule, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as his waies agree or diſagree with that rule,
ſo anſwerably to beare witneſſe with or againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, conſcience (ſay I) is a <hi>naturall power,
&amp;c.</hi> My meaning is, conſcience is an ability, wherewith God indowed
the ſoule of man by creation, as with other gifts and abilities, for his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, it he walked well; for his terrour if he walked ill. We may not
imagine, that conſcience came not into the world, untill after <hi>Adams</hi>
fall: this were to ſuppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, to 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9267:44"/>be a man without conſcience. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence indeed as an
accuſer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner, came not into the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till after <hi>Adams</hi>
fall; but conſcience as an accuſer, acquiter, and comforter, was in
<hi>Adam</hi> before his fall. As long as <hi>Adam</hi> obeyed the
commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, there was no cauſe that conſcience ſhould accuſe
him, but as ſoone as he diſobeyed Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, conſcience flew in
his face, as appeares by his flying from the face of God. Which plainely
ſhewes us this truth, that conſcience was in <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his
fall, but did not begin to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, 'til <hi>Adam</hi> began to ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſcience (ſay I) is a naturall power [<hi>which
the joule of man hath, &amp;c.</hi> Now whether this power be in the
underſtanding onely, or partly in the underſtanding and partly in the will,
I finde controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the learned. My opinion, I here humbly lay
downe, but I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not to ſtate and determine the controverſie. This
power we ſpeak of, I conceive to be a reflect act of the practicke
underſtanding onely, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently <pb n="71" facs="tcp:9267:44"/>ſeconded by the
power of the holy Ghoſt. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> confirmes the firſt, that it
is a reflect act of the practicke underſtanding onely, where ſpeaking of
this power in the ſoule, ſaith, <hi>And hereby we doe know, that we know
him, if we keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3. That is, as if
<hi>Iohn</hi> had ſaid, We doe view our waies by the word of God (which is an
act onely of the underſtanding) and finding them to be in ſome meaſure
levell with that holy rule, we have this comfortable reflection backe upon our
ſoules, that our faith is not a fancy, but a faith which worketh by love, and
ſo ſincere and ſaving: which reflection, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as I conceive, but
an act of the underſtanding, collecting a divine concluſion from divine
premiſes. He that keepeth Gods Commandements, knoweth God ſavingly; that he
may ſafely conclude: but I doe keepe the Commandements of God, this I know,
for I have viewed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and my life by them: and therefore
I know, that is, I am aſſured that I truely and ſavingly 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9267:45"/>know God: which is no other, but that power in the ſoule,
which we call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (I conceive) confirmes the
ſecond, that it is a reflect act of the underſtanding,
<hi>tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeconded by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> where he ſaith,
<hi>My conſcience bearing me witneſſe [in the holy Ghoſt,] Rom.</hi>
9.1. That is, my conſcience tranſcendantly ſeconded and aſſiſted,
by the holy Ghoſt, doth ſtrongly teſtifie to my ſoule, that I am full
of bowels towards my kinſmen after the fleſh, and could doe any thing, or
ſuffer any thing for their good. The order according to which the holy
Ghoſt ſtrikes in with conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is this. The underſtanding makes a
double propoſition, one grounded in the word of God, the other in the heart
of man: as thus, He that keepeth the Commandements of God, truely loves God;
this propoſition is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word of God: but I doe keepe the
Commandements of God; this is grounded in the heart of man: And then drawes a
concluſion from both; therefore I doe truely love God. <pb n="73" facs="tcp:9267:45"/>This concluſion whilſt holy and drawne from divine premiſes, to
wit, the word of God, and the grace of God in the heart of man; the Spirit of
God ſtrikes in with the ſoule, in making this concluſion, and
aſſiſts the weake ſoule, ſo that he concludes thus with <hi>ſtrong
confidence,</hi> that he truely loves God: and not onely ſecretly
aſſiſtes, but ſeconds, and ſaies the ſame thing to man, that his
owne ſpirit doth. Then is fulfilled that of the Apoſtle, <hi>the Spirit
beares witneſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the Sonnes of God.</hi> If
the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes be corrupt which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding makes, (for the minde
makes propoſitions ſuitable to the light that is in it, from which to argue
the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or badneſſe of man) then the Divell that lying ſpirit,
ſtrikes in and ſeconds the ſoule, in that corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which he
collects from corrupt principles, concerning himſelfe: So that now the
deluded ſoule is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and wiſer then ten men that give a reaſon:
in theſe is fulfilled that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Their minds and
conſciences being defiled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:9267:46"/>Thirdly, I affirme conſcience to be a
naturall power, which the ſoule of man hath <hi>[above all unreaſonable
crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c.]</hi> Bruite beaſts have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and yet they
better ſerve God in their kind, then many of us which have conſcience.
Bruit beaſts want reaſon, and therefore are not capable ſubjects of
conſcience; and yet againſt reaſon, and againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, man
ofttimes does worſe then a beaſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, conſcience (ſay I) is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power which the
ſoule of man hath above all unreaſonable creatures, <hi>[to compare his
waies by ſome rule; and according as his waies agree or diſagree with that
rule, ſo anſwerably to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with, or againſt him.]</hi> By
the former part of this deſcription, is ſhewed unto us, what conſcience
is according to its being in the ſoule: <hi>It is a naturall power,
&amp;c.</hi> By the latter part of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſhewed unto us,
what conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is according to its office in the ſoule.</p>
            <p>The office of conſcience, according to the deſcription here
given, conſiſts <pb n="75" facs="tcp:9267:46"/>in two things. Firſt, conſcience
<hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a mans waies by ſome rule.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Conſcience
<hi>beares witneſſe with or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man, according as a mans waies
agree or diſagree with that rule.</hi> Firſt ſay I, <hi>conſcience
compares a mans waies by ſome rule.</hi> If the underſtanding be
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with the truth, to wit, the word of God; then conſcience
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the waies of man, by a perfect rule, to wit, the word of God. But if
the underſtanding be inlightned, with naturall and morall principles onely,
then conſcience compares a mans waies according to theſe principles on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo by an imperfect rule. For 'tis my judgment, with ſubmiſſion to
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that conſcience in every man, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that light which the
underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding holds up unto it. This I know, that a man may and often doth,
goe againſt conſcience: but conſcience goes not againſt that light,
which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding holds up unto it. A man may outwardly ſay this or
that, contrary to the light of his underſtanding, but conſcience inwardly
ſpeakes, at the ſame time, according to that light. I <pb n="76" facs="tcp:9267:47"/>will further cleare this unto you, by an apt example. <hi>Paul</hi>
you know zealouſly perſecuted the Church of God, and his conſcience (for
ought that I can finde) never checkt him, but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe rather acquitted
him, for it; I meane as long as he remained uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. And the reaſon, I
thinke, is ſufficiently rendred, where 'tis ſaid, that he <hi>did it
ignorantly.</hi> That is, according to that light which his underſtanding
held up unto him, he thought he did God good ſervice, in ſheading the blood
of his Saints, which me thinkes makes manifeſt what I ſay, that
conſcience ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the light of the underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted the Church of God, and
yet obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, becauſe (ſaith the text) <hi>he did it
ignorantly:</hi> hee did out of conſcience (as I may ſay) ſhead the blood
of the Saints. But now the moſt men have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the
truth; &amp; therefore if now men perſecute the Saints of God, either in
heart, tongue, or hand, they goe againſt knowledge, &amp; ſo conſequently
againſt conſcience; <pb n="77" facs="tcp:9267:47"/>for conſcience followes the light
of the underſtanding; and ſo comes neere the committing of the unpardonable
ſin, to the committers of which God hath ſaid, there ſhall be no mercy
ſhewed, either in this world, or in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Here I would have you obſerve this, for the further clearing of
what hath beene ſaid, <hi>That the word of God is the rule, by which
conſcience compares the waies of men, ſo far-forth as the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is enlightened by the word of God, and no further.</hi> So far-forth as the
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is ignorant of the word of God, ſo far-forth conſcience is
ſilent. As long as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> knew not luſt to be a ſinne,
conſcience never accuſed him for luſt as a ſin. And this ſurely is
one reaſon why many ſhun the preaching of the word of God, and the ſtudie
thereof, leaſt by <hi>encreaſing knowledge they ſhould increaſe
griefe,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: leaſt by this meanes they ſhould
come to the knowledge of their ſinnes, and ſo conſcience pull them by the
throat for them. Of ſuch as theſe the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
ſpeakes where <pb n="78" facs="tcp:9267:48"/>he ſaith, <hi>Of this they are willingly
igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that by the word of God the Heavens were of old, and the earth, and
the world that then was periſhed.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3,4,5. That is, they
did purpoſely doe as much as in them lay, to put out that light which was in
their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which told them that he which at firſt made the
heavens by his word, and did by his word deſtroy them with water, would one
day againe deſtroy them with fire and brimſtone: this they did labour to
keepe themſelves ignorant of, that ſo they might without checke of
conſcience, goe on in their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>To ſuch as theſe I may truely ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>If
our Goſpell be hid, it is hid unto thoſe which periſh, in whom the God of
this world hath blinded the minds, of them which believe not, leaſt the light
of the glorious Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Image of God,
ſhould ſhine unto them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3,4. He that keepes
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ignorance, that his conſcience may let him goe on quietly in
wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, loves to goe to hell without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole. Thou that canſt not
indure, that <pb n="79" facs="tcp:9267:48"/>thy conſcience ſhould reprove thee
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, 'tis no wonder that thou canſt not endure, that thy miniſter
ſhould reprove thee publikely. Thou that canſt not endure that thy
conſcience ſhould reprove thee for ſinne now, muſt endure whether thou
wilt or no, conſcience to torment thee for thy ſin, hereafter.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that I would have you to obſerve is this,
<hi>That conſcience doth compare all a mans wayes with the rule of the word,
ſo far-forth as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is enlightned with the word.</hi> All
that light which the underſtanding hath received from the word of God,
conſcience takes it and makes it a rule, by which he meaſures all a mans
waies, thoughts, words, and deeds, to trie what agreement or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there is, betweene them and the rule.</p>
            <p>That conſcience compares the thoughts of men by the word of God,
ſo farre forth as the underſtanding is inlightned by the word, as well as
words and deeds, is manifeſt by the language of the Apoſtle, where he 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9267:49"/>ſpeakes of the Gentiles on this wiſe, <hi>Which ſhew
the worke of the Law written in their hearts, their conſciences alſo
bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witneſſe, &amp; their [thoughts] the mean while accuſing or
excuſing one another. Rom.</hi> 2.15. Divine light ſo far-forth as it
ſhines into the hearts of heathens, conſcience makes uſe of it as a rule,
by which to examine their very thoughts, and ſo anſwerably to accuſe or
excuſe them, as their thoughts are found to agree or diſagree with the
rule. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe in the ninth to the <hi>Rom.</hi> at the
firſt verſe, confirmes this truth. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt I lie
not, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt, that I have
great heavineſſe and continuall ſorrow in my heart, for I could wiſh my
ſelfe ſeparate from Chriſt, for my kinſ-folk in the fleſh.</hi> Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> here tels us that his conſcience did beare him witneſſe,
that his thoughts and deſires were thus and thus ſincere, reſpecting his
brethren; which conſcience will never doe, before he hath leavelled a mans
thoughts and deſires by the word of God, and found them to be ſo: by
conſequence then it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, <pb n="81" facs="tcp:9267:49"/>that conſcience
compares a mans thoughts by the rule, as well as his words and deeds.</p>
            <p>Conſcience keepes court in the heart, and therefore can and doth
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our thoughts, as well as our words and deeds. Conſcience keepes a
Court of juſtice in the heart, and ſits upon the life and death of the
ſoule, which is ten thouſand times more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then the body; and
therfore will not ſift this and that, and let other things goe, which the
word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes, as well, and as plainely, as it doth any thing elſe. The
word of God you know condemnes evill thoughts, as well as evill words; and not
onely groſſe evill thoughts, as thoughts of murder, adultery, and the like,
but <hi>vaine idle thoughts;</hi> and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can doe no
leſſe, as Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in this lower circuit, but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine theſe, as
well as words and deeds, by the rule of Gods word, to ſee how farre they
agree to, or diſagree from it. Which worke when conſcience hath exactly
done, then <hi>it! beares wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with or againſt a man, anſwerably
as <pb n="82" facs="tcp:9267:50"/>a mans waies agree or diſagree with this rule:</hi>
which is the laſt clauſe in the deſcription of conſcience, and comes
now according to order and method to be a little opened.</p>
            <p>Conſcience when he hath compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a mans waies by the rule, and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly found out how they agree with, or diſagree from it; the next thing
he doth, is, he beares witneſſe with, or againſt a man. This clauſe I
adde, in the deſcription of conſcience; becauſe 'tis a divine power
placed in the ſoule of man, to be as it were a judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man.
Conſcience takes notice of things together with God, and compares them by the
rule together with God, and then pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſentence with or againſt man,
for God. Firſt I ſay, conſcience takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of things together with
God: and hence it is, ſay the learned, that this power in the ſoule is
called <hi>conſcience. Scire</hi> (ſay they) is ſaid of him which knowes
one thing alone, ſo as none elſe knowes it with him. <hi>Conſcire</hi> is
ſaid of three or foure, which know ſome ſecret together.
<hi>Conſcience</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="83" facs="tcp:9267:50"/>muſt needs ſignifie a
combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two at the leaſt, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome ſecret thing.
Now this combination cannot be betweene man and man; for man doth not know the
ſecrets of my heart, no further then as I reveale them to him: this
combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neither cannot be betweene man and Angels, for they doe not know
the ſecrets of my heart together with thy ſelfe. This combination then
muſt needs be, between God and man. God knowes all our thoughts, <hi>There
cannot be a thought hid from thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job</hi> of God.<note place="margin">Iob
42.2.</note> And he knowes all our words and deeds: <hi>all things are naked
before him, with whom we have to doe.</hi> And man alſo by a gift from God,
knowes together with God, his thoughts, words, and deeds; and compares them by
the rule together with God; and then beares witneſſe with or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
himſelfe to God: and this gift we therefore call <hi>con-ſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here note this, <hi>That conſcience beares witneſſe with or
againſt a man, no farther then his waies agree or diſagree with the word of
God.</hi> There can be no bribing <pb n="84" facs="tcp:9267:51"/>of conſcience, to
ſpeak better or worſe of any man to God, then his waies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.
Conſcience beares witneſſe againſt a man, when having compared the
waies of man by the word of God, he findes them to diſagree from it. But here
poſſibly ſome of you may ſay, Doth any mans conſcience beare
wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt himſelfe? againſt his owne land-Lord, in whoſe
houſe he dwels? To this I anſwer, yes. The Apoſtle confirmes this, where
he ſaith, <hi>If our hearts condemne us, God is greater then our hearts, and
knoweth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.20. <hi>If our hearts condemne us,
&amp;c.</hi> Conſcience will give teſtimony and ſentence, againſt the
very wombe that beares him, if wicked; and ſo far-forth as he knowes it to be
wicked. Conſcience cannot now give an exact teſtimony, nor an exact
ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſinner, becauſe the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding holds not up
unto it an exact light: <hi>We know but in part,</hi> though God <hi>know all
things;</hi> and knowing but in part, conſcience yet can doe his office but
in part; but what he does is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and righteous, according to the 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9267:51"/>light which the underſtanding holds up unto him. But
hereafter when we ſhal all appeare before the judgement ſeate of Chriſt,
Chriſt will by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, ſet up a glorious light in every mans
underſtanding, ſo that they ſhall know all things done in the body
whether good or evill, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely as Chriſt himſelfe, and then
conſcience will ſpeake as plaine and as broad as Chriſt himſelfe: and
hence 'tis that men ſhall ſtand ſilent before the Judge of all the
world.</p>
            <p>The teſtimony which conſcience gives againſt a man now, is
very audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſo audible that it cauſeth the merrieſt heart, in the
midſt of laughter to be ſadde. It will make the ſtouteſt ſinner
ſtoop, his heart to ake and ſhake within him, and his countenance to gather
blackneſſe. But at the great day, it will make every ſinner in
<hi>Belſhazzars</hi> caſe, &amp; worſe, when he ſaw the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing in
the wall. It will make ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at their wits end: to <hi>wiſh for
mountaines to fall upon them, and cover them,</hi> or diſpatch them
utterly.</p>
            <p>Conſcience beares witneſſe with a <pb n="86" facs="tcp:9267:52"/>man,
when having compared his waies by the rule, he findes that they agree
therewith. So audible and ſo ſenſible is the teſtimony, that
conſcience gives now with a man, that it makes him to rejoyce in the midſt
of all outward troubles and hardſhips: <hi>For our rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is this</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> in the midſt of all their outward
trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) <hi>the teſtimony of our conſcience that in ſimplicity and
go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly ſincerity, not with
fleſhly wiſedome, but by the grace of God, we have had our conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſation in the World.</hi> Conſcience
ſpake ſo loud, and ſo plain, and ſo comfortable, in giving teſtimony
with them concerning their integrity, that they underſtood well what he
ſaid, and were more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this ſtill teſtimony within, then if
hundreds without, had given teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with them to their adverſaries, and
ſaid they were upright men. But much more audible and comfortable will the
teſtimony of conſcience with a man, be, at the great day: but I let that
alone till then.</p>
            <p>At preſert I hope you ſee enough, by this deſcription of
conſcience, to <pb n="87" facs="tcp:9267:52"/>confirme the truth in hand, to wit,
<hi>That conſcience can give teſtimony, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſimplicity or
hypocriſie of a mans converſation.</hi> Now the reaſons why God hath
given unto conſcience this power, are theſe: Firſt, That man might have
ſome thing within him, to comfort or terrifie him, when all things without
faile. Secondly, That Gods proceedings with man, may be by man, confeſſed
to be juſt. Laſtly, That God at the great day, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch a great
deale of weighty buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſpeedily.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God hath given this power to conſcience, to give
teſtimony concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſimplicity or hypocriſie, or mans
converſation, That ſo man might have ſomething within him, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or
terrifie him, when all things without him faile. If a man walke ſincerely,
conſcience will be a comfort to him, when father, mother, husband, wife,
wealth, and all friends faile him. And this comfort will be a continuall
feaſt, in famine; continuall honour, in diſgrace; continuall wealth, in
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; continuall liberty in bonds; <pb n="88" facs="tcp:9267:53"/>continuall peace, in
warre; continuall health, in ſickneſſe; continuall eaſe, under every
burthen. This was meate to eate, to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> which
the world knew not of. Nay, this was tranſcendent conſolation in the
midſt of troubles, to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> which the beleeving
Corinthians dreamt not of: and therefore 'tis, that they thus wrote to them,
<hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that we have
ſincerely ordered our converſation in the world.</hi> As if they had ſaid
thus, Though we have loſt many comforts, yet we have not loſt all; we have
ſomething within us, which is a continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us, in the midſt of
all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and miſeries, which we meet withall; and that is, the
peace of a good conſcience. And if man walk not ſincerely, conſcience is
by divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to be an accuſer, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in part an
executioner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the delinquent, in this life. This worme ſhall
gnaw within, when things are carryed ſmooth without. This dog ſhall bite
and teare within, when all are afraid to barke without. <pb n="89" facs="tcp:9267:53"/>This blood-hound ſhall dogge the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; let him goe with
<hi>Cain</hi> into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> into what place he will, or to
what imployment he will: ſo that proud man ſhall feele ſomething within,
for his wickedneſſe, when he feeles nothing without.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hath given this power to conſcience, to give
teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſimplicity or unſoundnes of mans
converſation; That ſo all Gods proceedings with man, both here and
hereafter, may be confeſſed to be juſt. <hi>One witneſſe, ſaid God,
ſhall not teſtifie againſt any perſon, to cauſe him to die,
Deut.</hi> 35.30. Two witneſſes God accounted ſufficient, to vindicate
eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of juſtice amongſt men: but under two, God would not allow
ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature againſt any man; that ſo judgement might be cleare, the Judge
confeſſed to be righteous, and the malefactour ſilent. God the great
Judge of all the world, keeps himſelfe to this rule, in his proceedings of
judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature againſt man. Two witneſſes will God have, againſt every
male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, to wit, Chriſt and conſcience. <pb n="90" facs="tcp:9267:54"/>God doth
immediately ſee all things done by man, and is a witneſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to
all that he commits in the body, as we may gueſſe by his owne words.
<hi>Becauſe they have committed vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany in Iſrael, and have committed
adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with their neighbours wives, and have ſpoken lying words in my
Name, which I have not commanded them, even [I know] and am a witneſſe,
ſaith the Lord, Jer.</hi> 29.23. By this we ſee, that God the Father ſees
our ſinnes, and is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but becauſe he will not be a
witneſſe in his own cauſe, he will have two ſufficient witneſſes
beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to wit, Chriſt, and conſcience: both very true.</p>
            <p>The Divell would willingly be a witneſſe againſt man, as an
evill ſpirit that knowes much by man, but does not know ſo much as the
Spirit of man, which is in him: and therefore not a ſufficient witneſſe.
But if that evill Spirit, did know as much by man, as mans owne evill ſpirit
which is in him, yet being corrupt, he would prove a falſe witneſſe
againſt man: a Knight of the Poſt, and ſweare any <pb n="91" facs="tcp:9267:54"/>thing againſt man, to bring as great miſery upon him, as is upon
himſelfe, if he might be admitted for a witneſſe, ſuch is his
divelliſh hatred and malice, to all beings better then his owne; but
therefore God will not admit of him as a witneſſe, for or againſt a man.
Two true witneſſes will God have, one without a man, and another within
him; one in heaven and another in earth; to wit, Chriſt and conſcience:
<hi>Behold I have given him for a witneſſe to the People,</hi> ſaith God
the Father of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. And this witneſſe is in
Heaven, ſaith <hi>Iob: Behold my witneſſe is in Heaven Job</hi> 16.19.
Not ſo in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that he is not alſo in earth; or as if he were ignorant
of any thing done in earth, for then he could not be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
witneſſe. <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes of Chriſt, according to his ſpeciall
place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence; and that is in heaven: but Chriſt hath a Country
houſe, here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in our hearts, where he hath one abiding continually, that
is equall to himſelfe, that tels him all, to wit, his ſpirit: ſo that
Chriſt is as competent a witneſſe as conſcience, that ſits as
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter <pb n="92" facs="tcp:9267:55"/>ſtill in the heart, and never ſtirres out
of his place.</p>
            <p>Theſe two witneſſes do, as that man was commanded to doe,
which had a ſheepe committed to his truſt, and the ſheepe torne in pieces
by wild beaſts; he was to bring ſome of that which was left; ſome horne
or hoofe, or any part elſe that was left for a witneſſe of the truth
thereof. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.13. Thus Chriſt and conſcience bring before God
&amp; the ſoule, thoſe precepts which were by God committed to man, to be
kept, and which he hath ſuffered his unruly heart to breake to pieces: my
meaning is, ſo lively doe theſe two witneſſes ſet before the
ſinner, the breach of every precept, according to every circumſtance, as
ever any party under the Law, could ſet before the owner, the tearing in
pieces of his cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, by the limmes and pieces thereof. And this being done,
divine ſentence is given, and the ſoule muſt needs be ſilent, being
ſo legally handled; and Angels and Saints be forc'd to breake forth and
ſay, <hi>Rightéous art thou O God in all thy waies, and holy in all
thy works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:9267:55"/>Laſtly, God hath given this power to
conſcience, to give teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mans ſimplicity or
hypocriſie, that ſo <hi>God at the great day, may diſpatch a great deale
of weighty buſineſſe ſpeedily. And I will come neere to you to
judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I will be [a ſwift witneſſe] a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſorcerers,
and againſt the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and falſe ſwearers,</hi> ſaith the Lord,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. What the Lord then ſpake reſpecting a particular
judgement, the ſame will be Gods proceeding with all at the great day. The
bookes ſhall be opened; Chriſts booke, and the booke of conſcience; and
ſo in a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in the <hi>twinkling of an eye;</hi> that is very
ſpeedily, all things ſhall be cleare to Judge and malefactour, without
troubling Juries, and other witneſſes, as we doe here, which would make a
long worke, at that great aſſize; and all perſons be judged &amp; ſent
to their place; and ſo righteouſly judged, that not one ſhall open his
mouth to complaine. Now this could not poſſibly be a work ſpeedily done,
if God had not given this power to conſcience, to reflect and give
teſtimony, and to be inſtead of, &amp; <pb n="94" facs="tcp:9267:56"/>better then a
thouſand witneſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and all debating pro and con, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them.</p>
            <p>The wiſedome of God is here to be admired: for he hath made
ſuch a witneſſe to give teſtimony with Chriſt for or againſt a man,
every way ſo fit, that nothing in the world can be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo fit. Chriſt
we muſt all confeſſe to be very ſit, to be Gods Delegate; becauſe he
came out of the boſome of God, and knows exactly all his Lawes, which he hath
given man to obſerve, which Angels doe not, and man is a party, and therefore
both unfit. But the holy Ghoſt cannot be judged fit to be mans Delegate,
becauſe one with the Father and Sonne, and ſo a party in the cauſe. And
as for Angels, they know not neither the propoſed rule exactly, nor the
aberrations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent; and as for men, they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the
cauſe, and ſo would juggle together, and ſweare one for another: or at
leaſt as one fleſh and bone, with fooliſh pity ſpoile a City (as we
ſay:) that is, they would ſpeake flattering and halting, and ſo
over-turne juſtice <pb n="95" facs="tcp:9267:56"/>at laſt, after a great deale of doe
with them. Now to prevent all this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, toile, and ſtirre; God hath
crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a power within man as to obſerve all things done by man; and
no leſſe one with man, then Chriſt is with the Father; and therefore as
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptible a Delegate for man on the one ſide, as Chriſt is for God on
the other ſide. And theſe two of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, without all diſturbance,
diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or turmoile, give in exact evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence concerning mans integrity
or hypocriſie; and ſo ſpeedily without all clamour, ſentence, and
execution, and all is finiſhed; and the Judge of all the world, does more
weighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe in a moment, and farre better, then all the Judges in
this world could do, in the age of the world.</p>
            <p>Having thus given you the point, and the grounds of it; let us
ſee in the next place, how uſefull this may be unto us all. Hath God given
power to conſcience, to give teſtimony concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſimplicity or
hypocriſie of mans waies? Why then let us all take heed, how we order our
converſation <pb n="96" facs="tcp:9267:57"/>in this world. Give leave to your ſoules
to thinke nothing, ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor doe nothing, but what you would have
written downe, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the Judge of all the world at the great day.
When we know a tale-teller is neare us, we are very carefull what we ſay, or
doe. Why, we have alwaies a tell-truth in our boſomes, where ever we goe, or
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we doe; who will tell all to the Judge of all the world, that we
thinke, ſpeake or doe: and therefore let us watch over our thoughts, words,
and deeds; and ſo thinke, and ſo ſpeake, and ſo doe, as thoſe that
looke to have the comfortable teſtimony of conſcience with them, at the
great day of account; <hi>That in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, we have
had our converſation in the world.</hi> Under the old covenant, God had a
<hi>Tabernacle of witneſſe,</hi> which was the inner Court where the Arke
was, in which the Law was, to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the Iſraelites,
when they did evill. So God hath now under the new covenant, <hi>a Tabernacle
of witneſſe;</hi> and this is the inner Court, to wit, the 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:9267:57"/>heart, where conſcience is, to give teſtimony againſt
us, when we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe. And therefore let us ſet a watch upon our
hearts, and tongues, and hands, and intreat God with <hi>David,</hi> to
<hi>hold up our goings in his pathes, that our foot-ſteps ſlip not.
Pſal</hi> 17.5.</p>
            <p>I note this, becauſe I ſee multitudes live, as if there were
neither conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor God, nor Divell, Heaven nor Hell. The ſpeech of
the Prophet of old, may I ſitly here make uſe of. Men were then ſo
audaciouſly wicked, that the very <hi>ſhew of their countenance did
teſtifie againſt them: they declared their ſinnes as Sodome, and hid them
not: Woe unto their ſoule</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>they have rewarded evill
unto themſelves, Iſa.</hi> 3.9. Thus may I ſay of multitudes amongſt us
now, The very ſhew of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, doth teſtifie againſt them. The
wanton eye, the fiery eye, the drouſie walling eye, the burly Malmſey
noſe, the painted face, Anticke poſtures, geſtures, and faſhions, doe
all as <hi>Iobs</hi> wrinkles in his face, teſtifie againſt thouſands,
that they little lay to heart this doctrine, <hi>That conſcience can
ſpeake, <pb n="98" facs="tcp:9267:58"/>and tell all their doings to God.</hi> Proud
<hi>Hamans,</hi> time-ſerving <hi>Doegs,</hi> drunken <hi>Nabals,</hi>
whoriſh <hi>Ieſabels,</hi> ſcoffing <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> declare their
ſinnes as <hi>Sodome,</hi> and hide them not; and as for conſcience, turne
him off with a glaſſe of Sacke, and a Play-houſe.</p>
            <p>But let me ſay to theſe wretches, with the Prophet, <hi>Woe
unto their ſoules, for they have rewarded evill unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> You
have made a long, blacke, bloody bill, for conſcience to open againſt you,
the laſt day of this Terme, to wit, at death; which ſhall be tried the
firſt day of the next Terme, to wit, as ſoone as you are out of the body:
and then will conſcience give teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo ſtrongly againſt you,
that if you would give ten thouſand Rivers of Oyle, nay, if you would give
the fruit of your bodie, for the ſinne of your ſoule, it ſhall doe no
good; the cauſe ſhall goe againſt you, and ſentence ſhall be paſt
upon you: and then ſhall you know by woefull experience, the meaning of that
place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>But after thy hardneſſe and impenitent heart,
treaſureſt up unto thy ſelfe wrath, againſt <pb n="99" facs="tcp:9267:58"/>the day
of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore three things I would give in counſell to you all:
ſeeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can give teſtimony concerning the ſimplicity or
hypocriſie of mans waies; ſuſpend him not; ſleight not his language;
but give diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what he ſaith. Let us not ſtop the mouth of
conſcience, ſeeing he can ſpeake, and tell us what we are. Many there are
that labour to ſtop the mouth of conſcience, when he tels them plainely of
their ſinnes, and to deſtroy that divine power which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath, to
ſpeake in them, and to them. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives us a hint of
theſe, where he ſaith, <hi>Scoffers ſhall come in the laſt time, and
ſhall ſay, where is the promiſe of his comming.</hi> For this (ſaith
he) they are <hi>willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, that by the world of God, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veni
were of old,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. When conſcience told thoſe
ſcoffers, that would live in their ſinnes, and ſcoffed at the day of
judgement, ſaying, where is the promiſe of his comming; that God made the
world by his word, and <pb n="100" facs="tcp:9267:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>drowned it quickly by his
Word, when it was overſpread with wilfull wickedneſſe; and therefore you
have like cauſe, to looke for like ſwift mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, for as much as you are
ſo wilfully and deſperately wicked. This ſharpe and plaine language of
conſcience, they could not indure; and therefore willingly laboured to darken
this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine light, and to ſilence this faithfull Houſe-Chaplaine. Thus
'tis with many ſinners now; Conſcience now and then, delivers ſtinging
language to their ſoules, for ſuch and ſuch ſinnes; and then they ſet
to lift this faithfull Monitor out of his place; and becauſe they cannot
poſſibly doe this, being ſo immediately inducted by God, they ſtrive to
gagge his mouth, and kill him; by running wilfully into wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
againſt all checkes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes of conſcience, and friends, as men
deſperately reſigning up their ſoules to the divell, becauſe God will
not humour, and ſatisfie them in their owne waies: and ſo ſhip wracke
faith, conſcience, ſoule, and all for ever. That which oft-times followes
upon <pb n="101" facs="tcp:9267:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>this, is ſelfe-ſtabbing, ſelfe-drowning,
ſelfe-hanging, ſelfe-poyſoning, and the like.</p>
            <p>This is crying wickedneſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable wickedneſſe.
'Tis crying wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe to ſtrive to gagge and kill conſcience. 'Tis
<hi>Dei-cidium,</hi> to murder God. Conſcience is no other but Gods
Vicegerent in the ſoule: or rather, Gods judiciary preſence in the ſoule.
So farre forth therefore as a man wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doth injury to this, he doth
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit high treaſon againſt the King of Heaven. 'Tis to ſtab the Judge
of all the world as he ſits upon the Bench, ſpeaking Law and Juſtice,
which very nature abhorres, as deſperatly divelliſh.</p>
            <p>And 'tis incurable wickedneſſe: for 'tis to deſtroy the
firſt <hi>medium</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, by which the holy Ghoſt workes in
man, to gagge and kill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The firſt thing that the Spirit of God
doth when he come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a ſinner, is to convince his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and
to make that ſting him for his ſinnes, and then ſtirre him up to long
after, and to ſeeke for Chriſt; and <pb n="102" facs="tcp:9267:60"/>then gives faith
in Chriſt, and ſo ſaves the ſinner. Now he that ſtrives to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
conſcience, undermines his owne ſalvation, in the very foundation and
firſt ſtone thereof. He doth wilfully and wickedly prevent his owne
ſoule, of all the good that God doth in this way, to bring ſinners home to
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Thou doeſt little conſider, O deſperate wretch, what great
wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thou committeſt, that ſtriveſt to gagge and kill
conſcience. Thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt double murther, in a ſpirituall ſenſe;
which is murther of the higheſt kind: thou doeſt murther God and thine owne
ſoule. And therefore I beſeech you all, to take heed of this practice.
Seeing God hath given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ability and parts to ſpeake, let him
ſpeake freely, though he ſpeake never ſo ſharply and plainely, and doe
not check him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2</note>Nay doe not ſleight him: which is the
next thing I would a little preſſe upon you. A man that can ſpeake, and
ſpeake to good purpoſe, though he be an enemy, we ſo farre honour him, as
to let him ſpeake out fully <pb n="103" facs="tcp:9267:60"/>what he hath to ſay, and
not turn away the eare from him: give but this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to conſcience. Many
deale with conſcience, as <hi>Felix</hi> did with <hi>Paul;</hi> he willingly
heard <hi>Paul</hi> a while, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the faith of Chriſt, but when he
came to reaſon of righteouſneſſe, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and judgement to come,
he ſet <hi>Felix</hi> into a trembling; and then ſaith he to <hi>Paul, Goe
thy way for this time; when I have a convenient ſeaſon, I will ſend for
thee, Act.</hi> 24.25. So many will heare conſcience, whilſt he gives
teſtimony with them, of this good thing, and that, which they have done, and
it may be whilſt he tells them of leſſer faults, but when once he comes
to reaſon throughly with them about their ſinnes, which are as deare as
right eyes, and right hands unto them, and threatens them home, <hi>with
judgement to come:</hi> when he tells them of that righteouſneſſe and
temperance which the word commands, how much they have neglected it, and what
they are liable to for it, and ſo ſets their ſoules into a cold ſhaking
ſweat, then they have enough of conſcience, and they <pb n="104" facs="tcp:9267:61"/>turne their eares and minds, to ſome other matters; and ſend
conſcience away, till they be better at leiſure: this is no other, but to
ſleight conſcience in his place.</p>
            <p>God will make no other of this, but contempt of his prime Court of
juſtice here below, and thoſe that ſit chiefe there, as for him: and thou
wilt finde no other, but a great deale of ſecret ſoule miſchiefe by this.
God hath no other Court here below, but the heart of man; and no Judge in this
Court, but conſcience: and conſcience being Gods Chiefe-judge, wilt thou
hearken to him when thou pleaſeſt; and when thou pleaſeſt, turne the
deafe eare to him, ſay what he will? Doeſt thou thinke that God ſweares
Judges for this lower Circuit, which know not Law, nor how to ſpeake upon the
Bench, worth the hearing? Doeſt thou thinke thy ſelfe too great, to be
arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God? and to anſwere to ſuch interrogatories, as he ſhall
put unto thee?</p>
            <p>As God will make no other but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this, ſo thou wilt
finde no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="105" facs="tcp:9267:61"/>but a great deale of ſecret ſoule
miſchief by this. To ſleight the voice of conſcience, is the ready way to
bring the ſoule, into ſecurity and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, which are unſenſible
dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning evils. When there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor royall Courts
of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, every man did what was right in his owne eyes. So when this
royall Court of conſcience is ſleighted, the ſoule will grow
feareleſſe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and man will give leave to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to
thinke, and ſpeake, and doe as he liſteth, and yet <hi>promiſe peace to
himſelfe, though he live in the wickedneſſe of his owne heart;</hi> then
which, what can be a greater ſoule evill?</p>
            <p>Wherefore honour God, in his Royall way of judicature: and
ſeeing he hath appointed an able Iudge in thy ſoule, of thy waies;
ſleight him not, but <hi>diligently hearken to what he ſaith;</hi> which is
the laſt thing I would a little preſſe upon you. Conſcience can
ſpeake better of thy waies, then any man can doe: therefore give him leave to
ſpeake, and diligently obſerve all his words, and tell me what he 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9267:62"/>ſaith to thee. Doth he not tell thee, that thou art a
drunkard, an adulterer, a ſwearer, a prophaner of the Lords day, an unjuſt
dealer, a ſelfe-ſeeker, a time-ſerver, a man that ordereſt thy devotion
and converſation, ſuitable to the times, a man that makes thine owne ends
thy aime, in all thy actions? Doth he not tell thee that thou art an idle
perſon, a buſie-body, a railer, a ſcoffer, and malicious perſon? Or
what is it that conſcience ſaith unto thee? For he ſpeakes to no man
elſe, but to thy ſelfe, ſo faithfull and diſcreet is he; and therefore
I can enquire of none but of thy ſelfe O ſinner, what conſcience ſaies
unto thee. Conſcience can give teſtimony with or againſt thee; prethee
hearken to him, and tell me what he ſaith. When Chriſt was arraigned, and
ſtood ſtill and ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the high Prieſt aroſe (ſaith the
Text) and ſaid unto him, <hi>anſwereſt thou nothing? What is it which
theſe witneſſe againſt thee? Math.</hi> 26.62. So ſay I to you,
conſcience doth arraigne you now and then, and he doth give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony;
what teſtimony is it that <pb n="107" facs="tcp:9267:62"/>he gives? Is it againſt you,
or with you?</p>
            <p>If againſt you: What is it that he accuſes you of, and
condemnes you for? Doth he condemne thee, for the vanity of thy thoughts, for
the levity of thy words and deeds? Doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee for the pride of
thine heart, or for the pride of thine heart and life both? Doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
thee for ſheading of innocent blood? for ſcoffing and perſecuting the
waies of God? Doth he condemne thee for hugging ſome ſecret ſinne, which
the word diſallowes? or for thy ſuperficiall perfunctory piety?
What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever conſcience accuſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes thee for, honour this
Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy ſo farre, as to weigh throughly what he ſaith; and call to minde
thy waies, and conſider whether they have not beene, ſo as conſcience
ſaith: and if ſo, then compare what conſcience ſaith of thy courſe,
with the word of God; and if conſcience within, and the word of God without
agree in one, in what they ſay againſt thy courſe; doe thou ſtrike in
with thy conſcience and <pb n="108" facs="tcp:9267:63"/>the word of God, and ſay of
thy ſelfe and waies, as they ſay, and joyne with them in judging and
condemning thy ſelfe, and thy courſes.</p>
            <p>And then begge the Lord, that he will not ſtrike in and judge
thee too; for if he judge thee too, then thou art gon for ever. Tell him, that
though thou haſt ſinned, yet Chriſt hath died; and here hold. And then
begge him to cleanſe and cure thy wicked heart, that thou maiſt goe, and
ſinne no more, leaſt a worſe thing befall thee: namely, to be delivered
from the hands of a condemning conſcience, into the hands of a condemning
God, who <hi>will teare thee in pieces, and there will be none to
deliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If conſcience give teſtimony with you, that you are <hi>pure
and upright,</hi> as he uſeth the expreſſion to <hi>Iob, that in
ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and godly ſincerity, you have had your converſation in the
world;</hi> why then, weigh your waies by the word of God, and ſee whether
the word of God ſaith the ſame of your waies which conſcience doth: if
ſo, why then doe you ſtrike in too, and ſay as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9267:63"/>and Gods Word doe, and ſo owne Gods great worke of grace
in your hearts, in making them upright; and thinke that thou canſt never
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare love enough to God, which hath declared ſo much love to thee, as to
make thee a man after his owne heart, to be a companion for his owne Sonne and
ſelfe, in grace and glory.</p>

in the midſt of troubles. Pauls</hi> and <hi>Timothies</hi> conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
giving teſtimony with them, concerning the ſimplicity and ſincerity of

of all the troubles they underwent. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the
teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, we

which becauſe they are more vehement then many other troubles are, <hi>the

               </gap>

in this darkneſſe, though <hi>the darkneſſe,</hi> that is very ſharpe
miſery, yet there ariſeth <hi>light in it;</hi> by light I conceive is here
meant, comfort and joy from conſcience, giving teſtimony concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their
uprightneſſe, as attended with the ſpirit of <hi>glory and of God,</hi>
as <hi>Peter</hi> calls the holy Spirit of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. If you conceive not
this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plaine enough, to conſent with my Text, read <hi>Davids</hi>
language in the ſeventh <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10,11. <hi>My defence is of God, 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9267:65"/>which ſaveth the upright in heart.</hi> God judgeth the
righteous; and God is angry with the wicked every day. As if <hi>David</hi> had
ſaid, This is my comfort in the midſt of all the troubles and feares I am
in, that my conſcience tells me, my converſation in the world hath beene
lead according to the dictate of an upright heart, no way injurious to theſe
ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> which labour to be every way injurious to me; and
therefore I am ſure that God, which is alwaies a defence unto the upright,
will be a defence unto me: God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the waies of the upright, and
ſmiles upon their ſoules to their great conſolation, when the world
frownes, this I ſinde by experience; but rotten wretches God is continually
angry with, and this he will firſt or laſt (I am ſure) make them to know
with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Salomon</hi> likewiſe conſents to this as a
truth, to wit, That the teſtimony of conſcience concerning the
ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of mans converſation, will yeeld him joy in the midſt of
troubles, as we may collect from his language, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.23. <hi>A man
hath joy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the <pb n="114" facs="tcp:9267:66"/>anſwer of his
mouth.</hi> When a man upon every occaſion ſpeakes ſincerely,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience within cheares and comforts a man whatſoever followes upon
plaine dealing to the outward man. 'Tis me thinkes as if <hi>Salomon</hi> had
ſaid, Let a man ſpeake ſincerely upon all occaſions, and he ſhall be
ſure to finde his conſcience comfort him, in the midſt of all troubles
that may follow upon it.</p>
            <p>Troubles are either naturall, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall. Naturall troubles I
call ſuch as man is borne unto, by reaſon of ſin. By the fall of
<hi>Adam, man is horne to troubles, as the ſparkes ſlie upward, Iob</hi>
5.7. to troubles in body, in ſoule, in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, in wife, in children, in
ſervants, in kindred, in friends, in ſubſtance, in all things that are
given man for his good. To the juſt as well as unjuſt, come troubles in all
theſe; onely here is the difference, conſciouſneſſe of ſimplicity
and ſincerity ſweetens all thoſe to the godly, whereas the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked muſt
ſwallow them in their full bitterneſſe. That conſcience, which tells a
man that in ſimplicity and godly <pb n="115" facs="tcp:9267:66"/>ſincerity, he hath
had his converſation in the world, will alſo tell him, that all troubles in
the fleſh, ſhall worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the good of his Spirit; and that God
will give ſtrength to beare them, and a ſeaſonable deliverance out of
them; and this ſweetens theſe bitters. That conſcience, which tells a
man, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, he hath ordered his
conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the world, will tell him alſo, that 'tis a wiſe and
gracious Father that doth thus, and thus afflict him; yea, conſcience now and
then ſhewes the ſoule, the bright beames of Gods ſmiling countenance,
that he may ſee that 'tis indeed a reconciled father which doth afflict; and
this like <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> honey revives much, and fetches life in
ſwooning fits, under great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. That conſcience which told
<hi>Iob</hi> that he was ſincere, told him alſo in the midſt of all his
troubles, that his Redeemer lived, and he ſhould ſee him, with his
fleſhly eyes: moreover it told him, that when God had tryed him, <hi>that
ſhe ſhould come forth as gold.</hi> This ſugared his bitter potion, and 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9267:67"/>ſweetned every bitter drugge he took. The like may be
ſaid of <hi>David;</hi> his conſcience told him that he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and
this conſcience told him alſo, that God was his God; <hi>Thou art my God,
and I will praiſe thee: thou art my God, and I will exalt thee. Pſal.</hi>
118.28. and that God would <hi>light his candle, and enlighten his
darkneſſe</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. 18.28.</note>: that is, turne
all his ſorrowes into joy, and his troubles into advantages; and this made
every burthen eaſie. Thus we ſee, that conſciouſneſſe to our
ſelves of the ſimplicity of our courſe, yeelds comfort in all troubles
for ſinnes ſake, which I call naturall troubles.</p>
            <p>Troubles cauſed by religion and religious walking, which I call
acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall troubles, becauſe by accident not of its proper nature, religion
exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates wicked men againſt us, theſe I conceive my text principally
points at; and as for all theſe, though the fierceſt kind of troubles, and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by <hi>David, the ſorrowes of hell,</hi> yet if a
Chriſtian hath but the voice of conſcience with him, that he hath walked
ſimply &amp; ſincerely in the <pb n="117" facs="tcp:9267:67"/>world, this will keepe
his head above water, though theſe waves be never ſo tempeſtuous: this
will make a man ſing in a dungeon at midnight, as <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas</hi> did: this will make a man ſmile in fiery flames, as many of
the Martyrs did: this will make a man alwaies rejoyce, in the midſt of all
ſorrowes: <hi>as ſorrowfull, yet alwaies rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
6.10. Sorrowfull alwaies were the Apoſtles of Chriſt, ſuch hard uſage
they alwaies met withall from the world, for the Goſpels ſake; and yet in
the midſt of all, joyfull, becauſe of that ſweet peace which their
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſpoke unto them, that they were not ſuch as the world judged
them to be, but were ſimple and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in life and doctrine; and ſo
this Scripture ſounds the ſame in ſenſe and ſubſtance with my text:
<hi>For our rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is this, the teſtimony of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in
ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſedome, but by the
grace of God we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have ſeene now, in what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the teſtimony of
conſcience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <pb n="118" facs="tcp:9267:68"/>a mans ſimplicity, will
rejoyce a Chriſtian. I will in the next place ſhew you, what rejocying 'tis
that the teſtimony of conſcience will yeeld a man in trouble. Joy is either
ſenſuall, or ſpirituall. Senſuall joy is a meere and naked joy in the
creature, ſo farre as it pleaſeth the ſenſes. Of this joy ſpeakes
<hi>Solomon,</hi> where he ſaith, that <hi>he with-held his heart from no
joy, Eccl.</hi> 2.10. That is, any thing that might delight any ſenſe, he
got to him: he had <hi>men ſingers and women ſingers, and all the delights
of the ſonnes of men.</hi> Thus to order a mans converſation, is to live
ſenſually and not ſincerely; and therefore conſcience gives teſtimony
againſt this man, and not with him; and ſo conſequently checks and curbs
this joy, and not cauſeth it: conſcience dampes this mirth much, by griping
the ſpirit now and then, in the midſt of laughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spirituall joy, is the ſoules rejoycing in God, as
reconciled in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spirituall joy, is the ſoules</hi>] <hi>rejoycing in God,
&amp;c.</hi> Divine joy is therefore called ſpirituall, becauſe the
ſubject <pb n="119" facs="tcp:9267:68"/>of it is a ſpirit, and the object of it is a
ſpirit, and all the manifeſtations of it ſpirituall. The ſubject of
divine joy, is the ſpirit of man. Divine joy doth not take onely the eare, or
the eye, or the taſte, or the ſmell, as carnall joy doth, but the heart:
<hi>Let the heart of them rejoyce, that ſeeke the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 105.3.
The heart is broken for ſinne, and this is made to rejoyce in Gods mercy, as
a pardoner of ſinne: the ſame bones which are broken, are made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.
<hi>Make me to heare joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the bones which thout haſt
broken may rejoyce. Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was ſo
overcharged with ſorrow, that his bones were ready to breake in his body, and
in this he deſired ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine refreſhing, that ſo all things out of
order might be quieted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againe. As ſorrow is no ſorrow,
unleſſe it take the heart; ſo joy is no joy, unleſſe it warme the
Spirit. And therefore ſaith <hi>David, My ſoule ſhall be joyfull in the
Lord, [it] ſhall rejoyce in his ſalvation. Pſal.</hi> 35.9.</p>
            <p>God doth honour that in man with joy, with which man honours him
by <pb n="120" facs="tcp:9267:69"/>obedience: now, the ſoule of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, obeyes
God. <hi>My Soule hath kept thy teſtimonies, and I love them excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
Pſal.</hi> 19.167. and therefore God made <hi>Davids ſoule</hi> to rejoyce.
<hi>I delight to doe thy will, O God, yea thy Law is within my heart,
Pſal.</hi> 40.8. The Law of God was within <hi>Davids</hi> heart, and
therefore the joy of God was within his heart too. Hypocrits doe not with their
ſoules keepe Gods teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; their righteouſneſſe is like
<hi>Ephraims,</hi> an outſide righteouſneſſe that vaniſheth, and ſo
anſwerably God giveth them an outſide ſuperficiall joy, that ſoone
vaniſheth and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth. They doe not <hi>ſet their hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi>
to obey God, as <hi>David</hi> uſeth the expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
78.8. and therefore God doth not tune and ſet their joy aright, ſo that it
jarres at the beſt; their ſpirits and their faces, are not alwaies merry
together; <hi>in the midſt of laughter their hearts gripe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divine joy takes the ſpirit of man <hi>wholly,</hi> and
oft-times <hi>immediately.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine joy takes the ſpirit of man wholly
when at loweſt. A dram, a ſparkle, the <pb n="121" facs="tcp:9267:69"/>leaſt
meaſure of divine joy that can be thought of, revives and makes glad the
whole Spirit of man, as a drop of ſtrong water warmes the whole heart. Hence
'tis, that <hi>David</hi> when he had but a drop of divine joy, diſtilled
into his heart (as 'tis but a drop of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly liquor, that our weake
giddy ſoules can beare, whilſt here below) preſently he breakes out as a
man war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all over: <hi>I will praiſe thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I
will ſhew forth all thy marvellous workes, Pſal.</hi> 9.1. The like
phraſe you ſhall finde <hi>David</hi> often ſpeaking in. <hi>David</hi>
found his whole heart warmed by thoſe ſparkles of divine joy, which God
ſtrooke in his darke dolorous heart, and this fetcht life in him ſtill,
when ready to faint and ſwoon, and then all he returned to God againe, which
he gave him; God warmed his whole heart with joy, and he returned his whole
heart to God in thankeſgiving. Divine joy warmes all that is within, and all
that is without, ſoule and body, and ſets both at worke to praiſe God.
<hi>Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and all that is within me praiſe his 
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:9267:70"/>holy name. Pſal.</hi> 103.1. All that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>David,</hi> was warmed with divine joy, and therefore all that was within
him, he would have ſhould returne thankes and praiſe unto the Lord.
Elſewhere, he cals upon all without him. <hi>And my ſoule ſhall be
joyfull in the Lord, it ſhall rejoyce in his ſalvation:</hi> this is for
all within him: then in the next verſe ſaith he, <hi>All my bones ſhall
ſay, Lord who is like unto thee. Pſal.</hi> 35.9,10. Divine joy warmes all
that is within a man, and all that is without: it warmes Spirit, fleſh, and
bones; the whole man, and ſets all on fire to praiſe the Lord.</p>
            <p>As divine joy takes the Spirit <hi>wholly,</hi> ſo it oft-times
ſeiſes upon the Spirit <hi>immediately;</hi> breaking forth in the heart as
lightning, without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowne <hi>medium,</hi> by which to come into
the ſoule. <hi>David</hi> doth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hint this, where he ſaith,
<hi>Rejoyce the ſoule of thy ſervant, for unto thee, O Lord doe I lift up
my ſoule, Pſal.</hi> 86.4. Thou needeſt not this to ſpeake in, or that
creature to worke by, to revive a drooping Spirit, as if the Pſalmiſt had 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9267:70"/>ſaid, thou canſt put joy and gladneſſe into the
ſad ſoule of man, by thine owne immediate worke, as well as if forty
Miniſters were imployed: this I beleeve, that none without thee can rejoyce
me, but thou without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther canſt doe it; and therefore unto thee, doe I
lift up my ſoule. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God doth worke by ſecondary meanes and
inferiour inſtruments, to rejoyce the ſoules of mourning ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as
<hi>David</hi> would have comforted <hi>Hanun</hi> by his meſſengers: at
other times, he will make uſe of none but his owne Spirit, to beare
witneſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the Sonnes of God, and walke
before him as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent children, and ſo rejoyces the ſoules of his people
in troubles. Thus did God rejoyce the ſoule of <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> in their troubles and ſorrowes: by the Almighty worke of
his Spirit, he aſſured their ſpirits, that they were his, and that their
waies were pleaſing to him; which made them thus to ſpeake, in the midſt
of miſeries, <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that in ſimplicity and godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:9267:71"/>not with
fleſhly wiſedome, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
in the world, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, divine joy is called <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi> becauſe
the object of it is a ſpirit. The object of divine joy is God, who is a
Spirit, ſaith <hi>John.</hi> Divine joy hath God for its immediate object,
and all other good things as beames of this Sunne, as ſtreams from this
fountaine, as mediat objects comming from, and relating to God. God alone is
the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of divine joy. Moſt true 'tis, that God hath alwaies in his right
hand Heaven; and in his left hand earth, to wit, all the Kingdomes of this
world, to beſtow upon whom he will; but had he neither, or would he part with
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to any beſide himſelfe, but keepe all in his owne hand, yet an
upright man would joy in him, and deſire no better object to let out his
affections upon. <hi>Although the Figge tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither
ſhall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the Olives ſhall faile, and the
field ſhall yeeld no meate, the flocke ſhall be cut off from the folds, and
there be no herd in the ſtalles, yet I will rejoyce in <pb n="125" facs="tcp:9267:71"/>the Lord; I will joy in the God of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> ſaith the
Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17,18. <hi>Habakkuk</hi> will riſe in judgement
againſt a thouſand thouſand ſoules, which would never judge God worthy
to be lookt after, muchleſſe delighted in, if he had not Corne and Wine,
Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth to beſtow upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorits. This text I conceive is a
plaine teſtimony, that God alone is the object of divine joy: that is, not
God as very wealthy, and very bountifull, but as very holy, and an abſolute
compleat being, above all things beſide him. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> joy, to
wit, in God alone, as he whom his conſcience told him, he ſerved
ſincerely, though weakely.</p>
            <p>Upright men eye the divine rule in their rejoycing, as well as in
all other things. Now the divine rule of joy, is, that it ſhould be bounded
and terminated in God. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord ye righteous, Pſal.</hi>
97.12. This rule is repeated againe and againe in Scripture, to note how apt we
are to rejoyce in creatures, and ſinnes which are worſe then any creatures,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:9267:72"/>and not in God: as alſo to note, how ſtrictly God
lookes at this, that we ſhould make him onely the object of our joy, and all
other good things, as beames of this Sunne, as bleſſings from his hand; and
ſo conſequently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce ſtill, as long as we have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with
God, and our conſciences witneſſing with us that we ſincerely ſerve
him, though we have nothing elſe in the world beſide him, as <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Timothy</hi> did. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our
conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly
wiſedome, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the
world, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, divine joy is called <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> becauſe
all the manifeſtations of it are ſpirituall. They that have this joy in
their hearts, do not let their tongues ſing ribaldry and vanity, ſuch as
fleſh and blood delights in, but they <hi>ſing in the waies of the Lord,
Pſal.</hi> 138.5. That, is, they rejoyce in divine things, to be thinking,
and ſpeaking of, and walking in, the waies of the Lord. 'Twas <hi>Pauls</hi>
and <hi>Timothies</hi> matter of joy, that they <pb n="127" facs="tcp:9267:72"/>could
walke ſincerely in the waies of the Lord, and this they humbly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in.
Such as have the joy of the Lord in their hearts, their tongues ſpeake, and
ſing, in ſuch a manner, that God is extolled and magnified, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to
one attribute or another, which is <hi>making melody to God,</hi> as the
Apoſtle termes it. As here in my text, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſo expreſſed
divine joy, that the power and goodneſſe of the Lord were magnified, that
he could and would give internall comfort, to thoſe that did ſincerely,
though weakely ſerve him, when all externall comforts failed. Divine joy doth
not, as carnall joy, tranſport men into drunkards, whore-maſters, wantons,
libertines, and ſo turne them out of the waies of the Lord; but raiſes
their ſpirits, to a higher pitch of love to God, and ſo makes them walke
more ſtrictly and chearfully, <hi>in the waies of God.</hi> Divine joy makes
a man rejoyce and worke righteouſneſſe, and not rejoyce and worke
wickedneſſe. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh
righteouſneſſe, Iſa.</hi> 64.5. <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Timothy</hi>
thus rejoyced, <pb n="128" facs="tcp:9267:73"/>that they could worke righteouſneſſe,
that they could order their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſincerely, though by many
hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led injuriouſly. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our
conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly
wiſedome, but by the grace of God, wee have had our converſation in the
world, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Divine joy is the ſoules
rejoycing in God [as reconciled in Chriſt.]</hi> Divine joy, as man upon
earth is the ſubject of it, hath God in Chriſt for its object: that is, God
as reconciled in Chriſt; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe God is an enemy, and no man
rejoyceth in an enemy. <hi>And not onely ſo, but we alſo rejoyce in God,
through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have received the attonement.
Rom.</hi> 5.11. We cannot joy immediately in God, as <hi>Adam</hi> could,
becauſe of our ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> which made God angry with us: we
muſt now have ſome to interpoſe betweene God and us, in whom is made up,
what is wanting in us, and ſo Gods anger againſt us appeaſed: and
therefore 'tis, that the Apoſtle thus ſpeakes in the perſon of the godly,
<hi>we joy in God <pb n="129" facs="tcp:9267:73"/>[through] our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by
whom we have received the attonement.</hi> This is ſweetly ſet forth alſo
unto us, under metaphoricall termes by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah. I will greatly
rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoule ſhall be joyfull in my God, for he hath
clothed me with the garments of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he hath covered me with the robe
of righteouſneſſe, as a Bride-groome dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe with ornaments,
and as a Bride adorneth her ſelfe with Jewels, Iſa.</hi> 61.10. God as
cloathing us with the garments of ſalvation, and as covering us with a robe
of righteouſneſſe, is the object of joy to fallen man; and thus we know,
he doth in Chriſt. God free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveales an infinite love to man in Chriſt,
and this begets love to him, and joy in him. He waſhed away all our ſinnes
in Chriſts blood, covers all our wants with Chriſts righteouſneſſe,
ſubjects his Sonne to ſuffer what we had deſerved, and to merit for us,
all that from which we were juſtly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to wit, communion with God, and
eternall life. This love, God ſheads abroad in the heart of man, and this
makes man love God, and joy in him. <pb n="130" facs="tcp:9267:74"/>God out of Chriſt,
is no other but a condemner of man: conſcience ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending God, is no
other but a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentour of man: and man betweene both theſe is in no other
but Hell: and there is no joy in Hell. God in Chriſt reconciles man to
himſelfe, and then God joyes in man, and man in God. The blood of Chriſt
makes peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man, and betweene man and his conſcience; and
makes God acquit, and conſcience acquit: God to ſpeake peace, though man be
not perfect; conſcience to ſpeake peace, though man walke weakely, yet
whilſt ſincerely; and this makes divine ioy in the heart, in the midſt of
all troubles, naturall or accidentall. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the
teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
not with fleſhly wiſedome, but by the grace of God, we have had our
converſation in the world, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have had a briefe hint now, by what hath beene ſaid, what
that joy is, which the teſtimony of conſcience brings to the ſoule, to
wit, <hi>a concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory joy,</hi> as I may fitly call it. A joy of 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9267:74"/>peace and friendſhip, betweene God and man, and betweene
man and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to wit, conſcience. Conſcience tels that man which
walkes ſincerely, that he for his part is at peace with him; and that God is
the like, though men and divels be at variance with him; and that he ſhall
have favours ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and temporall, here and eternally hereafter, ſay
and doe all his enemies what they can; and this makes the heart of man leape
within him, in the midſt of troubles, as the babe in <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
wombe, when ſhe heard the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation of <hi>Mary. Our rejoycing is this,
the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly
ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſedome, but by the grace of God, we have
had our converſation in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſhewed you in what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the teſtimony of
conſcience will give joy; and what joy 'tis that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cauſeth in
the ſoule, I will in the next place ſhew you the ground of the point, why
the teſtimony of conſcience, concerning a mans ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, muſt needs
cauſe joy in the midſt of troubles. This teſtimony of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence 
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9267:75"/>is attended with a <hi>glorious power,</hi> as the
Apoſtle calls it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>according
to the glorious power of him,</hi> ſaith the originall, that is, of the holy
Ghoſt, which makes the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſo ſtrong, and ſo tranſcendently
comfortable, that troubles and ſorrows for ſincerity ſake, though never
ſo great, cannot poſſibly over-beare the heart. <hi>Strengthned with all
might accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to [his glorious power] unto all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long
ſuffering, with joyfulneſſe.</hi> 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 11. There is a
<hi>glorious power,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the teſtimony of conſcience, extended
to upright ſoules, in times of great troubles for uprightneſſe ſake,
which ſtrengthens them <hi>with all might,</hi> ſo that all burdens cannot
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them; <hi>unto all patience and long ſuffering,</hi> ſo that
they will never be weary, and out of breath with bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and to doe all this
<hi>with joyfulneſſe,</hi> ſo that no outward hardſhip, can ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
exhauſt joy out of their ſpirits. Now, the teſtimony of conſcience
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſimplicity and ſincerity, being attended with this
<hi>glorious power</hi> in times of trouble, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 'tis, 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9267:75"/>
               <hi>the ſpirit of glory and of God reſts upon
ſuch,</hi> it muſt needs keepe up the dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit of man, and make
him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the greateſt troubles. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi>
doubtleſſe found this glorious power, attending the teſtimony of their
conſcience, ſtrengthning them with all might, unto all patience and long
ſuffering with joyfulneſſe, which made them thus to ſay, <hi>For our
rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity
and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſedome, but by the grace of God,
we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2</note>Secondly, the teſtimony of
conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence concerning mans ſimplicity and ſincerity, muſt needs
rejoyce a man, in the midſt of all troubles, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience now
minds a man, that he walkes in the midſt of all enemies and troubles, juſt
as Chriſt did. There was no guile found in Chriſts mouth, though he was put
to it againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: Whatever he underwent from his Father, from the
divell, and his children, yet ſtill he walked ſincerely, and faultered not
in the leaſt kind, for <pb n="134" facs="tcp:9267:76"/>the greateſt advantage, though
he was proffered all the kingdomes in the world, to doe it. Now, when
conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells a man, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, he hath
had his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the world, it doth at once tell him, that he hath
walked in this world, juſt as Chriſt did. As he was, ſo art thou in this
world, O my ſoule; which cannot but rejoyce the heart, in the midſt of the
ſharpeſt afflictions for Chriſts ſake. Thy Saviour, O my ſoule,
though God, yet was called a divell, nay <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the prince of
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; though temperate, yet called a drunkard and Wine-bibber, and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to Publicans and Harlots; though a man without guile, yet called a
deceiver; though innocent, yet ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, impriſoned, condemned, and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted as a malefactour. 'Tis juſt thus with thee O my ſoule: thou art
ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to walke uprightly, and yet cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for an hypocrit: thou
laboureſt to be better then any, and yet the world judges thee to be worſe
then any: thou laboureſt more for humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and love, then for all the wealth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:9267:76"/>in the World, and yet the World judges thee to be fuller
of pride, and malice, then any man: thou doſt not blow a Trumpet, when thou
giveſt almes, but hideſt from thy left hand, what thy right hand doth, and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world thinks that thy religion towards God, is without mercy
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man: thou thinkeſt no evill to others, but laboureſt to doe good
to all, and yet all almoſt thinke evill, or ſpeake evill, or doe evill
againſt thee. In this, O my ſoule, thou art not alone, 'twas the condition
of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; therefore mourne not, O my ſoule, but rejoyce, according to
the divine rule, that thou art made like him. Thus the teſtimony of
conſcience concerning a mans ſincerity, brings in matter of comfort and joy
to the ſoule of man, in the midſt of troubles, and makes it ſmile, when
under heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of cruelty.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it muſt needs be, that the teſtimony of conſcience
concerning the ſimplicity of a mans converſation, ſhould miniſter joy
in the midſt of troubles, becauſe ſuch plainely ſee 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:9267:77"/>their intereſt, in the divine word of conſolation.
<hi>Be glad in the Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce ye righteous, and ſhout for joy all ye
that are upright in heart, Pſal.</hi> 32.11. Conſcience now tels me that I
am up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart; and that in ſimplicity and uprightneſſe I have had
my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the world; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that joy here, as
well as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, belongs to me. Out of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, betweene
conſcience and the divine word of conſolation, joy will breake forth in the
ſoule firſt or laſt, lade an upright man with what bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens you will.
<hi>Rejoyce all ye that are upright in heart,</hi> ſaith God: thou art
upright in heart, ſaith conſcience to a ſincere ſoule; and conſcience
will not ſtay here, but will preſſe upon the ſoule to apply his owne
mercies; why then doſt not thou rejoyce? Doſt thou thinke it a ſmall
matter, to diſobey a command of God? This preſſing lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of
conſcience, will make a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſoule ſtrive hard, and pray hard, to
reioyce in afflictions for Chriſts ſake, according to the divine rule,
which prayer God will heare, and bring the <pb n="137" facs="tcp:9267:77"/>upright foule
at laſt, to ſay in the midſt of troubles, with theſe champions in my
text, <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our conſcience, that
in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſedome, but by
the grace of God we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having given you the point and the grounds of it, a word or two I
would ſpeake, by way of application, to you that are unſound, and then a
word more to you that are ſincere, and ſo conclude this point. This
doctrine may in the firſt place ſerve to unfold a riddle, to you that are
unſound. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you may wonder, to ſee a man goe reioycing to
priſon, and to fire and fagot, eſpecially when cenſured by learned men,
for ſuch and ſuch a malefactour: you it may be thinke of ſuch a man, as
he of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he is mad and merry without cauſe, as bedlams are;
or elſe that he laughs from the teeth outward, as he that would put a good
face upon an ill matter. No, no, doe not iudge ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably, it may be
this man hath meat to eate, which ye know not of. <pb n="138" facs="tcp:9267:78"/>It may
be he hath his conſcience teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying within, that he hath walked in all
uprightneſſe, and is not ſuch a one, as the world hath cenſured him to
be; and this makes him reioyce, in the midſt of all troubles. 'Twas
wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to ſee the three children walke in
the fiery furnace, as if they had been walking in his ſtately walkes;
becauſe he was not aware that they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> ſuch a divine comfortable companion, as they had. So 'tis
wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to blind worldlings, to ſee men ſo chearfull in ſuffering for
trifles in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as they call them) and the reaſon is, becauſe they
know not that divine comforter conſcience, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally within them,
&amp; unto them, a feaſt. This is to walke ſincerely, to be tender to obey
all Gods will, and this conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tels the ſoule, in the midſt of all
the troubles he undergoes, from men of corrupt minds, and large conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and this language of conſcience, being attended with the <hi>glorious power
of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> as a comforter, this ſoule cannot but reioyce,
though blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon a Pillory, groaning upon a <pb n="139" facs="tcp:9267:78"/>Racke,
dying upon a Croſſe, and condemned by wiſe men for a foole, in ſtanding
out in ſuch ſmall matters.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as this doctrine tells you blinde ſoules, the reaſon
why ſome are ſo chearfull, under great troubles, for ſmall things; ſo
it tels you that are a little more growne in hypocriſie and wickedneſſe,
that your deſigne againſt the godly is fruſtrate. The maine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of
the divell and his children, in all the troubles he puts them to, is, to
deprive them of all ioy and comfort, &amp; to make their being upon earth hell,
which is a place without all conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now this they can never doe, for
as much as they cannot deprive them of the peace of conſcience, and ioy of
the holy Ghoſt, which goe hand in hand, in an upright heart. True it is, if
all the ioy of the godly, did conſiſt in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, as wicked mens
ioy doth, then poſſibly they might ſerve the godly, as God will one day
ſerve them, to wit, utterly ſtrip them of all conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but the
leaſt part of an upright mans ioy, conſiſts in externall things; his
prime ioy is within, from conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <pb n="140" facs="tcp:9267:79"/>and the holy
Ghoſt which keepe company alwaies with it; and theſe two, all the wicked
men upon earth, nor all the Divels in Hell, cannot ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, muchleſſe
ſilence from ſpeaking comfort to an upright heart. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will
ſtill ſay this within, that he which ſo walkes as before mentioned, is
upright; when men and divels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, ſay, that he is an hypocrit, a
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, and not worthy to live. And the Holy Ghoſt will ſtill
ſecond this language of conſcience, by ſpeaking over the ſame againe:
in ſuch glorious expreſſions, and with ſuch ſweetned words, will the
ſpirit of God, beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the ſpirit of man, that doe what
you will to this man, he will ſtill, notwithſtanding all, rejoyce. Caſt
him into priſon; nay, caſt him into a dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a dirty dungeon, as
<hi>Jeremies</hi> was; nay, caſt him into a fiery Furnace; into a fiery
Furnace heat ſeven times-hotter then ordinary, <hi>Give his backe to the
ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and his cheeks to them that plucke off the haire, as the Prophet
ſpeakes, Iſa.</hi> 50.6. doe what you will to him, yet you will never
deprive him of his joy. As <pb n="141" facs="tcp:9267:79"/>long as breath is in his
noſtrils, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will comfort him; and when this is gone, by thy
cruelty, he will be in fulneſſe of joy; and in the fuller, by how much the
more cruelty thou haſt inflicted on him. The joy of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is
proportioned to what we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, for conſcience; <hi>as the afflictions of
Chriſt, abound in us, ſo ſhall our joyes</hi> both here and hereafter.
And therefore doe not breake your ſleepe and your braines, to plot
miſchiefe againſt the upright, for they will have more joy in ſuffering
cruelty, then you can have in inflicting it. You doe but leſſen your owne
joy, to encreaſe theirs. The more terrible you are unto them, the more
ſhall the teſtimony of conſcience be attended, with a glorious Spirit of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, which will make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be <hi>exceeding glad,</hi>
under all that you can inflict; and this will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly vex you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this doctrine will acquaint you with this truth. That if
conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſincerity, will leſſen and ſweeten troubles, by
giving joy to the upright in the midſt of them; conſciouſneſſe 
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9267:80"/>of hypocriſie and unſoundneſſe, muſt needs
imbitter all troubles, and make them more preſſing and piercing, upon you
that are halters, and time-ſervers: this was that which <hi>Iobs</hi> friends
drove at, in all their diſcourſes with him, to bring him to ſorrow doubly
and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for as much as all his outward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, were attended (as they
concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) with inward rottenneſſe: intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and that truly, that it
muſt be ſo, and will be ſo with all hypocrits, when conſcience is once
throughly awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to tell them of their unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, under
afflictions. What a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſting will this be, to a man in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, when
his conſcience ſhall tell him. Thou haſt ſhuffled and ſhifted
baſely to get wealth, and yet by all thy unjuſt waies, thou canſt skarce
keepe a cue above a begger. This blunt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of conſcience, will be
ſuch an addition of ſorrow to poverty, as will exceed the preſſure of
poverty, when at greateſt. What a ſting will this be to a man in
diſgrace, when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall tell him, Thou haſt beene a
time-ſerver; one that haſt ſtudied to <pb n="143" facs="tcp:9267:80"/>humour and
pleaſe men, more then God, that thou mighteſt get honour, and keepe honour
in the world, and yet for all thy dog-like fauning and flattering, thou
ſtinkeſt in the noſtrils of all, and art caſt unto the dung-hill as
unſavory ſalt. What a ſting will this be to a man in ſickneſſe and
death, when his conſcience ſhall tell him, that he hath beene but an
out-ſide Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, all the daies of his life; a man zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous about humane
inventions and bodily exerciſes, to give God the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and
careleſſe to worſhip God in ſpirit and truth: this cloſe language of
conſcience, will paine a man more then any ſickneſſe, or death can doe.
This was that which ſtung <hi>Balaam</hi> worſe then death, that his
conſcience told him, he had beene but an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit all his life. This made
<hi>Judas</hi> hang himſelfe, after he had ſold his maſter for money, for
as much as his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence told him then ſtrongly, that he had beene but an
hypocriticall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Chriſt, from the firſt to the laſt. And thus
would every rotten wretch doe or worſe, in every little <pb n="144" facs="tcp:9267:81"/>trouble, if God ſhould not admirably ſtep in, and reſtraine and
hinder, ſo terrible is the ſting of conſcience, when it teſtifies
againſt a man, and ſuch deepe additions of griefe it bringeth to the
ſoule, in every calamity. <hi>Sharpe arrowes</hi> and <hi>coales of
Iuniper,</hi> conſcience ſhooteth and kindleth in the ſoule of man, in
every trouble, when it teſtifieth againſt him, as the Pſalmiſt uſeth
the expreſſions, in relation to the hypocrit, the man concerning whom I
here treat of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.4.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I would exhort all you, that are unſound at heart, to
beg up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearts at the hands of God, that you may walke uprightly, and ſo
have the teſtimony of conſcience with you, to rejoyce you in all your
troubles. You labour by hooke and by crooke to get wealth to ſtand by you,
and to comfort you in troubles; and this will prove <hi>gravell in your
bellies</hi> to torture you, as <hi>Salomon</hi> affirmeth, ſo farre will it
be from comforting you in troubles. The teſtimony of conſcience concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
your ſincerity, is better then all the wealth in the world, to ſtand by 
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9267:81"/>you and to revive you in troubles. You flatter and faune,
turne and wind, ſhuffle and ſhift, to get great men to be your friends to
ſtand by you, and to comfort you in troubles; and alaſſe their favour is
a vapour; as unconſtant as the wind. Walke ſincerely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
will be a faithfull friend for you to the death; yea, after death, in
judgement. If thou hadſt the favour of all the Princes in the world, yet
could not they procure for thee a dram of comfort in ſicknes, in death, or in
judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: conſcience in all theſe times can, and will procure for thee,
not onely drams, but flaggons of conſolation, if thou walke ſincerely.
Conſcience is an incomparable friend, or foe, in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, death, and
judgement.</p>
            <p>The blindneſſe and folly of man above all other creatures, is
much to be wondred at; he hunts after things <hi>which are not,</hi> as
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, to be comforters to him, and takes no paines to
procure that, which will indeed be ſtable and abiding comfort to him, in all
ſtates. Riches, and honours, and friends, all the things of this life, they 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:9267:82"/>are, called by <hi>Solomon, things that are not,</hi>
becauſe they are not ſuch things, as the blind heart of man conceives them
to be: he thinkes they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make him happy, and they are not
ſo. The leaſt fit of ſickneſſe, will <hi>non-plus</hi> all theſe
things, for revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſoule. Vaine man like that foole, thinkes that he
hath comfort enough for many yeares; that is, for all his life, when he hath
great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news in the world, and therefore ſings a <hi>requiem</hi> to his
ſoule, as if there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no other thing, to the tranquillity of the Spirit,
throughout a mans life, but wordly things; and alaſſe! theſe things are
not abiding, but ſtill upon the wing, ready to flee from us; and if they were
abiding, yet they are not ſatiſfying; and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> calls
them <hi>vanity and vexation,</hi> to the Spirit. Conſcience is a laſting
friend, and a ſubſtantiall friend, to the ſpirit of man. A friend that
hath ſuch waters of life, which will revive the ſoule in the greateſt
extremities; and he is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine made by God, that will never wax dry; So
that the ſoule, as long as <pb n="147" facs="tcp:9267:82"/>ſhe keepes her ſelfe
ſincere, ſhall never be without a ſpring of joy, boiling up day and
night, within her.</p>
            <p>And this joy is not a low priſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, a thing little
worth: 'tis called in Scripture, a <hi>joy of the Lord,</hi> ſuch a joy of
God, as is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of man. When the Levits had opened the Law
unto the people, their conſciences were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, and ſmote them ſo,
that they <hi>wept,</hi> ſaith the text, and weakened and unfitted
themſelves, for the duties of the day; and therefore the Levits were faine to
comfort them, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience might take hold on ſomething, to worke joy
in them, which is the ſtrength of the ſoule, unto the duty of
thankſgiving, which was the ſpeciall worke of that day. As an accuſing
condemning conſcience, ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes ſpirits and ſtrength of
ſoule and body; and when attended onely with a legall ſpirit, begets ſuch
a horrid griefe in the heart of man, as unfits for the higheſt and nobleſt
ſervice of God: So an acquitting conſcience, doth exhilarate and revive the
ſoule; and as being attended with an evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall <pb n="148" facs="tcp:9267:83"/>ſpirit, begets ſuch a joy in the heart, as tunes &amp;
ſtrengthens it, unto all divine duties, eſpecially unto thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
which is the higheſt &amp; hardeſt divine leſſon, that can be played
upon the heart of fallen man, but makes the ſweeteſt melody in the eares of
God, of all divine leſſons committed to man, to learne. If thou then
wouldſt be a ſweet ſinger in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a man apt and able to
that which God moſt loves, walke ſo that conſcience may ſtill be an
acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within thee: if this accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee, 'twill put every
ſtring in thy heart out of tune; conſume thy ſpirits, &amp; make thy
living a continuall dying, &amp; yet death undeſirable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, divine joy is called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an <hi>exceeding joy.
I am exceeding jayfull in all our tribulations,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. The joy which conſcience gives to an upright man in all
tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for uprightneſſe ſake, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joy; a joy that
doth farre more take, content, and delight the ſoule, then any other joy can
doe: ſo the Apoſtle explaines this clauſe, by that which goes before it
in the ſame <pb n="149" facs="tcp:9267:83"/>verſe. <hi>I am [filled] with comfort</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>I am exceeding joyfull in all our tribulations.</hi>
Conſcience gives ſuch a joy to the ſoule in tribulations, that ſils the
ſoule with comfort, which is more then all the ſweets and delights of this
world can doe. The delights of this life they doe not reach the ſoule of man;
they reach no further then the externall ſenſes, ſo farre are they from
filling the ſoule with comfort; and yet they doe not fill nor ſatisfie
theſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the eare
with hearing, nor the noſe with ſmelling, nor the tongue with taſting,
nor the hand with hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. 'Tis but a tyring, and not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying joy,
that all outward things bring to the outward ſenſes. That joy which onely
the externall ſenſes bring into the ſoule, <hi>Salomon</hi> calls
<hi>madneſſe,</hi> as not worthy of the name of joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it reaches
not the ſpirit of man as rationall, but as meerely ſenſitive. The joy
which conſcience brings into the ſoule, doth not barely reach the ſoule,
but it filles it and ſatisfies it. <hi>My ſoule ſhall be ſatisfied as
with marrow and <pb n="150" facs="tcp:9267:84"/>fatneſſe, &amp; my mouth ſhall
praiſe thee with joy full lips; when I remember thee upon my bed, and
meditate upon thee in the night watches, Pſal.</hi> 63.5.6. If thou wilt live
all thy daies, with the joy of a bruit, with a meere ſenſuall outſide,
ſpiritleſſe, vaine, vexing joy, then thou needs not take paines to order
thy converſation ſincerely, to get thy conſcience to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
thee; but if thou wouldſt live all thy daies in the joy of a man that beares
the Image of God, then muſt thou ſtrive ſo to walke, that conſcience
may beare witnes that thou art ſincere.</p>
            <p>The Scripture doth not ſtay here, but calls divine joy
<hi>everlaſting;</hi> which is an attribute ſo high, that it leads us
neceſſarily to the originall, to wit, God, who is everlaſting. As hell is
a place of everlaſting ſorrow to all that be in it, becauſe a river of
Brimſtone from an everlaſting fountaine, runnes to it; ſo heaven which is
begun in joy upon earth, to wit, in the hearts of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, 'tis
everlaſting; becauſe freſh ſtreames of conſolation continually come
from an everlaſting fountaine, to wit, God. God alwaies ſeconds
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <pb n="151" facs="tcp:9267:84"/>in him that is ſincere, with ſuch a
<hi>glorious power</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, that though he be
alwaies in ſorrowes for Chriſts ſake, yet he is alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing:
<hi>As ſorrowfull, yet alwaies rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. You may
many waies cauſe ſorrow to an upright man, but yet joy will live in all,
and outlive all his ſorrowes. You may ſet on fire the body of an upright
man, and conſume that; but you can never ſet on fire his joy and conſume
that. You may va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious waies kill a ſincere man, but you can no way kill his
joy, as long as he holds faſt his integrity. The joy that conſcience gives
to the ſoule of man, upon teſtimony of his ſincerity, 'twill live in
fire, 'twill live in water, 'twill live in this land, 'twill live in any land;
famine cannot ſtarve it, plague cannot infect it, the ſword cannot murther
it, the racke cannot teare it; 'tis very healthy, 'tis long-lived, 'twill never
die: 'tis from heaven, and will abide with the ſoule untill he come to
hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and then will be conſummated, to give full ſolace to the ſoule
for ever. If then thou wouldſt have joy <pb n="152" facs="tcp:9267:85"/>to ſticke
bythee, in health, in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in peace, in warre, in plenty, in
famine, in honour, in diſgrace, in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in bonds, in life, in death, and
eternally after death, walke ſo that thy conſcience may ſay that thou art
ſimple and ſincere in thy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Scripture ſtayes not here, but calls divine joy
<hi>unſpeakeable and full of glory.</hi> As that joy which juſt men made
perfect inherit, is beyond conception, ſo that it cannot enter into the heart
of man to conceive of it, ſo that joy which conſcience gives to upright men
in troubles, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion: the tongue of man cannot fully
expreſſe it. I doe not affirme that the heart of man cannot fully conceive
it, though poſſibly it may be ſo. 'Tis joy unſpeakeable ſtrong:
ſtronger and more vehement, then the joy of worldlings, when Corn and Wine
and Oyle increaſe; and yet 'tis hard to expreſſe how much joy an earthy
heart hath, in great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe. 'Tis joy unſpeakeable 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9267:85"/>ſweet; ſo that he which taſtes of this joy, taſtes
no more ſweetneſſe in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall things, then in the white of an egge:
'tis ſweeter then the Honey or the Honey-combe: that is, ſweeter and more
pleaſing to the ſoule, then all the delights of this life, to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
heart; and yet 'tis hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, how ſweet and pleaſing
ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all delights are, to the carnall heart of man.</p>
            <p>'Tis joy unſpeakeable pure: as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>the feare of the Lord is cleane;</hi> ſo I may ſay, that the joy of the
Lord, which he gives to man upon the teſtimony of conſcience concerning his
ſincerity, 'tis cleane; that is, 'tis pure, unſpeakeable pure, and holy.
What was ſaid of the generation of Chriſt, that may be ſaid of the
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of divine joy. <hi>Who can declare his generation?</hi> ſaith the
Scripture of Chriſt; ſo may I ſay, Who can declare the generation of
divine joy? 'Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the heart, as Chriſt was in <hi>Maries</hi>
wombe, to wit, by the holy Ghoſt: 'tis ſhead abroad in the heart, by the
holy Ghoſt: 'tis continually <pb n="154" facs="tcp:9267:86"/>nouriſhed and cheriſhed
by the holy Ghoſt. It fils the heart full of holy thoughts, the mouth full of
holy words, and the hand full of holy deeds. It is immediatly from heaven, and
makes a man have his converſation in heaven, whilſt on earth.</p>
            <p>'Tis joy unſpeakeably precious: a dramme of it is more worth
then the world: a damned ſoule in hell would give ten thouſand worlds, if
there were ſo many, for the leaſt droppe of this cooling comforting liquor,
to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage his ſcorching torments, but for a moment. It hath heaven in
it, with which what can be compared for worth? 'Tis <hi>joy unſpeakeable, and
full of glory.</hi> The ſmiling face of God, which is more glorious then the
Sunne, may be ſeene in it, ſo diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous is it.</p>
            <p>'Tis joy unſpeakably laſting: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all other joyes die
when man dies, if not long before; this joy lives, as long as the ſoule and
God lives. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then ſo to live, that conſcience may teſtifie before
God and you, that you are ſincere, and ſo leade your <pb n="155" facs="tcp:9267:86"/>ſoules into that unſpeakeable joy, which will make you
unſpeakeably happy.</p>
            <p>I have now a word or two to you which walke ſincerely and
uprightly in this world, &amp; ſo I ſhut up this point. If you doe not yet
finde experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, the truth of this point; to wit, your conſciences
cauſing you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the midſt of your troubles, by alively
teſtifying your integrity to you, then by prayer plead your integrity to God,
and intreat him ſo tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſecond conſcience, with his
<hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power which worketh in us,</hi> that your hearts may be revived
under every preſſure for pieties ſake. Thus <hi>David</hi> was forc'd to
doe ſometimes, to wit, pleade his integrity, to finde the benefit of it in
troubles; for God will be ſought unto for every good thing, though we be
never ſo ſincere. <hi>Let integrity and uprightneſſe preſerve me: for
I waite on thee, Pſal.</hi> 25.21. <hi>David</hi> you ſee was put to it, to
plead his integrity to God, to obtaine the benefit of it in troubles; and thus
muſt we ſtill doe if we finde our hearts <pb n="156" facs="tcp:9267:87"/>to droope in
troubles, although we are conſcious to our ſelves of our upright and
innocent converſation. Say, Lord thou knoweſt that I have walked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly
as concerning this thing and that, about which I am troubled, and therefore doe
thou ſtand up in my heart, and ſecond my conſcience by the Almighty power
of thy holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and make it ſpeak peace ſo lively and ſo
gloriouſly within mee, that I may rejoyce in this tribulation for thy ſake;
that I may finde my integrity, as a cordiall to me, to keepe me from fainting
in my mind, and from ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out tongue or hand to iniquity.</p>
            <p>If you finde the comfortable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of conſcience,
reviving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing you in your troubles, then bleſſe God with
<hi>David,</hi> that he hath enabled you ſo to walk in this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world,
as to have the voice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with you, that you are ſincere. 'Tis of
God that we walk uprightly a moment: did not he ſtand by us, and watch over
our deceitfull hearts, and uphold our goings in his paths, wee ſhould ſhew
our ſelves hypocriticall <pb n="157" facs="tcp:9267:87"/>wretches in all our wayes.
<hi>God is my ſtrength and power; and hee maketh my way perfect, Pſal.</hi>
28.32. When the lively teſtimony of conſcience, concerning <hi>Davids</hi>
integrity, had rejoyced, and raiſed his dull ſpirit, then he tooke wing,
and made his ſoule mount up to heaven like an Eagle, to magnifie God which
had beene ſuch ſtrength and power to him, as to make his way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that
is, ſincere, and ſo capable of deliverance from his inſulting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<hi>[God] is my ſtrength and power; and [he] maketh my way perfect.
David</hi> would not appropriate the praiſe, of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and innocent
converſation to himſelfe, as if he by his own wiſdome, ſtrength and
goodneſſe, had made his way perfect, and upright; he had through experience
of the rottenneſſe of his owne heart, and his aptneſſe to declare it,
if God had not beene a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſtrength and aide unto him, in his
converſation; and therefore doth he ſo humbly and imitably ſay, <hi>[God]
is my ſtrength and power; and [he] ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my way perfect.</hi> 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 22.33. he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me ſo to walke, as to be capable 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9267:88"/>of the accompliſhment of his promiſes of defence
againſt, and victory over ungodly men, and no wiſedome, ſtrength, or
goodneſſe of his owne. Thus let us humbly doe; when we feele our hearts
leape within us, as rejoyced by the ſecret teſtimony of conſcience,
concerning the integrity of our carriage, in this or that matter of weight and
triall that we were put upon; Thou waſt my wiſedome, ſtrength, and power,
O God, to guide and enable me to walke uprightly in ſuch and ſuch hazardous
matters; my heart is deceitfull, and full of baſe feare, and if thou hadſt
not ſtood up as a mighty God in my weake ſpirit, I had beene over-borne
with fleſhly feares, and ſelfe-reſpects, to the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my
integrity, and thy Goſpell and glory: bleſſed be thy name, that didſt
enable me to looke over all by ends, to thy glory; and to acquit my ſelfe, at
the time of triall, anſwerable to my upright purpoſe and reſolution: 'tis
of thee to will and to doe good, and unto thee I give all the glory. This is
the good way to have God ſtand by <pb n="159" facs="tcp:9267:88"/>us ſtill, and ſo
mightily to guide us in all our waies, that we ſhall keepe faith and a good
conſcience to our grave, and ſo conſequently our joy, which is the life
of our lives. This was upright <hi>Iobs</hi> ſweet carriage, as we may
gueſſe by his language. <hi>Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my
ſoule: I would deſpiſe my life.</hi> If I were for holineſſe, as
juſt men made perfect in glory, yet whilſt a ſoule ſo holy, is in a
body ſo diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I could not take any pleaſure in my life. Thus to
interpret theſe words, is to give us a hint and more, that <hi>Job</hi> was
extreamely overgone with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under Gods hand, which is the worſt that
can be ſaid upon this place: I thinke there may be hinted this unto us (if
the other be the maine ſcope) that <hi>Job</hi> ſaw all the integrity and
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe he had, or poſſibly could be had, was from God, and that
he had no reaſon to boaſt, and magnifie himſelfe, what ever his
endowments were.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if you finde by comfortable experience the truth of my
doctrine, <pb n="160" facs="tcp:9267:89"/>your ſincerity, cauſeth joy and rejoycing in
our ſoules, then hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for perſeverance in a ſincere way, that
your joy may abide, and ſtill more and more increaſe, as the light of the
Sunne unto the perfect day. You have taſted of the ſweetneſſe of a
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere way, and therefore you ſhould zelouſly follow God, to keepe you
on in it, as long as breath is in your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, that you may never looſe
your grapes, your firſt-fruits of the holy Land, your taſte of heaven,
untill you come to the full fruition of it. 'Twas <hi>Davids</hi> prayer often
(and let it be yours) though he were ſincere, that <hi>God would make his
heart ſound in his ſtatutes.</hi> There is much rottenneſſe in the
beſt heart, and this will breake forth in a mans life, to the diſhonour of
God, and the wounding of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and robbing of his joy, if he be
not ſtill with <hi>David,</hi> hanging upon God by prayer, for more and more
uprightneſſe, and for further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleanſing of an unſound
heart. Things that are apt to bend and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come crooked, we are every foote 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:9267:89"/>rectifying and ſtraightning them, and labouring to
ſtrengthen them, ſo that they may abide ſtraight, and ſo be ſtill fit
for uſe and ſervice. You know to what to apply this, if I ſhould not tell
you, to the heart of man. Flattery or violence will turne you aſide, from
your ſincere walking, if you doe not humbly ſeeke God ſtill with
<hi>David,</hi> to make your heart ſound in his ſtatutes, and to be ſtill
with you, to uphold your ſteps in his paths. You will ſhip wracke
conſcience, and all the peace and joy you have by it quickely, as
<hi>Peter</hi> did, if you grow confident of your owne ſtrength, and doe not
feare alwaies, and depend upon your God, for ability, to doe every thing
upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And therefore leane not to your owne underſtanding, as
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaid to his ſonne, nor to any parts elſe you have, to
ſteere your converſation, if you would maintaine the integrity and
uprightneſſe of it; but renounce all in your ſelves, and begge God to
make you runne and not be weary, and to deliver you from backſliding in heart
and life, to make you faithfull <pb n="162" facs="tcp:9267:90"/>to the death, and to give
you at laſt the crowne of life.</p>
            <p>This counſell that you may care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully follow, thinke on theſe
two or three things. The peace and joy of a good conſcience, is better then
the greateſt preferment in the world, and the loſſe of it, is worſe
then the loſſe of thy life, in the cruel'ſt way that man can invent. Thou
wilt looſe a little heaven, and create within thy heart a little hell, which
will laſt till the marrow of thy bones be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and thy moiſture
turned into the drought of ſommer, in the day that thou turneſt aſide
from thy ſincere courſe, and ſetſt conſcience againſt thee. The joy
of an acquitting conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is unſpeakable and full of glory: and ſo
the ſorrow of an accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning conſcience, is unſpeakable and
full of terrour.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſorrow unſpeakeable ſtrong. What God ſaid to the
woman, after ſhe had turned aſide from the upright way of the Lord, that
may I ſay of all the ſeed of the woman, when once they turn aſide from
their upright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. <pb n="163" facs="tcp:9267:90"/>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the woman God
ſaid, I will greatly multiply thy ſorrow, Gen.</hi> 3.16. Sorrow
multiplied, is to have <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon ſorrow,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi>
uſeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to the Philippians.<note place="margin">Phil.
2.27.</note> As in child-bearing there is pang upon pang; and theſe returnes
of pangs, grow ſtill ſtronger and ſtronger, till the wombe be
diſcharged of her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: ſo ſay I to you, in the day that you turne
aſide from upright walking, God will greatly multiply your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; you
ſhall have ſorrow upon ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, pang upon pang by an accuſing
conſcience; and theſe pangs ſhall ſtill be ſtronger and ſtronger,
till you have humbled your ſoules throughly for your halting, and got your
conſciences ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſorrowes which God diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to his, when they turne
aſide from ſincere walking, they are ſorrowes fetcht from hell, and
thoſe ſorrowes, of all ſorrowes, are the ſtrongeſt. <hi>The
ſorrowes of hell compaſſed me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. To turne
aſide from upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe, was the practice of the evill
angels, for whom hell was <pb n="164" facs="tcp:9267:91"/>firſt founded, and therefore
God doth borrow ſome ſorrowes from thence, to puniſh ſuch ſinnes in
his children, which carry a neere ſimilitude to their ſinne: that
<hi>ſimiles vitio,</hi> may be <hi>ſimiles ſupplicio;</hi> like in
ſinne, may be like in puniſhment. The ſorrowes which God inflicts upon
revolters, for ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude ſake, are called the ſorrowes of hell.</p>
            <p>The ſorrowes of hell God diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in anger, as
<hi>Job</hi> ſaith. <hi>How oft is tho candle of the wicked put out? and oft
commeth their deſtruction upon them: God
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſtributeth ſorrowes in his
anger. Ioh.</hi> 21.17. So the ſorrowes which God diſtributeth to his
people, when they turne aſide from their ſincere wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, are from God, as
with an angry frowning viſard upon his face, as if he were indeed very angry,
as indeed he is with the ſinne, though not with the perſon of the godly;
for he hates ſinne in all, with a perfect hatred. The ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes which God
will diſtribute to thee by accuſing conſcience, when thou halteſt,
ſhall be ſuch as in which thou ſhalt ſee nothing, but the angry 
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:9267:91"/>face of God, and this will make thee tremble &amp;
ſorrow, as the Lord ſpeakes of the Babylonians. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.29. as the
very damned in hell doe, as one that feeleth the very ſorrowes of hell to
compaſſe thee. God looking angerly upon the earth, it trembleth, ſaith
the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.32. The earth is the vaſteſt and
graveſt body under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore leaſt apt to ſhaking; &amp; the
foundations of it were laid, by Gods owne immediat hand; and yet if God doe but
looke angerly upon this firme ſtable body, ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly founded, it
trembleth: how much more then needs muſt man, which is but a little duſt of
that grave vaſt body, ſhake and tremble, when God as an angry God lookes
upon him?</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſorrowes of hell are ſuch as principally torture
the ſpirit. The fire which we make, can onely burne and torture the bodies of
men; becauſe this onely of man is materiall:

               </note> immaterials, as the
ſoules of men are, our fire cannot faſten upon: but that <hi>ſtrange
fire,</hi> which God hath kindled <pb n="166" facs="tcp:9267:92"/>in hell, for all that
diſobey him, burnes the ſoules of men, though immateriall ſubſtances.
Nay, ſo ſtrange is that fire, that it burnes theſe immateriall
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances moſt fiercely, as being the moſt ſinfull part of man; for
'tis onely ſinne that pitches and defiles the ſoule, and makes it
combuſtible, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would never burne, if all the fiery artiſts
of hell did blow the bellowes. Now, juſt ſuch is that fire, which
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience kindles upon the breach of integrity; to wit, a fire that
principally tortures the ſpirit of man: a fire that burnes inwardly, and
conſumes the marrow of the bones, and drinkes up the ſpirits. The arrowes
which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhootes in upon a man, upon the breach of ſincerity,
are ſuch as pierce principally the ſpirit. As long as <hi>Iob</hi> was
patient under Gods hand, he felt the arrowes of the Almighty onely without him,
as I may ſay, to wit, in his body, in his children and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but
when he brake out and curſed his day, he preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, that he
felt the arrowes of God within him, &amp; that the poiſon of 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:9267:92"/>them did drinke up his ſpirits. <hi>Iob</hi> 6.4. All
that which before he felt without, was nothing to that which he now felt
within, upon his ſpirit; as the torments which damned wretches ſhall
ſuffer in their bodies, are nothing to thoſe which ſhall continually flee
up and downe, within their ſoules. So <hi>David</hi> after he had made
breaches in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, God filled his loines with loathſome
diſeaſes, but this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſpeake of; God made things ſtrike
into his heart, and then he roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>I am feeble and ſore broken, I have
roared by reaſon of the [diſquietneſſe of my heart.] David</hi> felt
paines gather about his heart, and then he cries out. The heart is the marke
that God princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally aimes at, when a Chriſtian hath turned aſide from his
upright courſe: other outward parts he may hit and deepely wound, but this is
but to make holes into the heart, where the ſeat of unſoundneſſe that
principally offends him is. The fire which conſcience kindles, it may flaſh
forth into the eyes, and tongue, and hands, and make a man looke fearefully,
ſpeake deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, <pb n="168" facs="tcp:9267:93"/>and doe bloodily againſt the
body; but the heate of the fire is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally within, in the furnace, in the
ſpirit; 'tis but ſome ſparkles and flaſhes onely, that you ſee come
forth at the lower holes of the Furnace, which you behold in the eyes, words,
and deeds of ſuch men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſorrowes of hell are torturing, but yet not ſuch
as utterly conſume and end the ſoule. The fire which we make, let it
faſten on never ſo hard a thing, yet it will conſume it in length of
time. But that ſtrange fire that God hath kindled in hell for all that
diſobey him, though it burne with the greateſt fierceneſſe that can be
conceived, yet it never conſumes the ſoules of thoſe that are now burned
in it; no nor yet the bodies that ſhall hereafter be burned in it. Damned
ſoules are ever burning, and yet never burned; ever a conſuming, and yet
never conſumed; and this addes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to the miſery of the damned.
Even ſuch is that ſire which conſcience kindles in the ſoule of man,
upon the breach of integrity. 'Tis a fire that <pb n="169" facs="tcp:9267:93"/>will burne
and torture the ſoule day and night, but never conſume it. <hi>He-man</hi>
complaines that this fire burnt ſo fiercely in his ſoule, that it
<hi>diſtracted</hi> his ſpirit, but yet did not end his ſpirit. <hi>While
I ſuffer thy terrour I am diſtracted, Pſal.</hi> 88.15. The terrours that
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience kindles in the ſpirit, will racke the ſpirit, rend and teare
limme from limme, faculty from faculty, and make the ſpirit mad with horrour
and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, but yet for all this not put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the ſpirit: he
ſhall be as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive and as ſenſible of tortures to day as
yeſter-day, and to-morrow as to day, and next weeke as this weeke, next yeere
as this yeere, the laſt day of his life, as the firſt day they begun, if
God doe not admirably intercept. Conſcience hangs the ſoule in chaines
alive, upon the breach of integrity; and there lets the ſoule beate
himſelfe, bite and gnaw himſelf, but yet cannot when he would end
himſelfe, and this makes every torture double. <hi>O that I might have my
requeſt! and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</hi> Why what
<hi>Iob</hi> doſt thou long for? <pb n="170" facs="tcp:9267:94"/>Why, <hi>even that it
would pleaſe God to deſtroy me: that he would let looſe his hand and cut
me off.</hi> No <hi>Iob,</hi> your ſpirit has hanged but a while, 'tis not
dead yet, and therefore it ſhall not be cut down. The things that
<hi>Jobs</hi> ſoule refuſed to touch, were made by conſcience his daily
ſorrowfull meate, and this Gall and Wormwood fretted his guts, but did not
ſtrangle and end him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience forc'd him every day, and every night to
drinke a new draught, that kept his Spirit in continuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet he
could not get his ſoule out of this body, nor have it conſumed in. The
terrours that conſcience kindles they are ſo terrible, that they will make
a man wiſh for death, nay inflict death upon himſelfe, and all to put an
end unto them, and yet all will not doe, becauſe theſe tortures faſten
upon the Spirit, but deſtroy not the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Finall, the ſorrowes of hell, they are ſuch as are not in the
leaſt meaſure pittied by God. Though the damned in hell, be tormented with
ſulfurous flames, which is a very fierce fire; and <pb n="171" facs="tcp:9267:94"/>though they cry and roare, howle and yell, ſhrich and gnaſh the
teeth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and all this in the hearing of God continually, which would
ſtirre, nay, turne the bowels of any man, to heare but a moment; yet it
ſtirres not God a jot, though he hath heard theſe dolorous cries ſo many
hundred yeares, to give them the leaſt good word, or good looke. So that
ſorrow which conſcience raiſes in the ſoule, upon, the breach of
ſincerity, God ſeemes not to pitty in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for a long
time. Though the ſpirit of man be rackt, tortured and affrighted even unto
diſtraction, yet God will not ſo much as afford a good looke to the
ſoule. Though he pray and faſt, and conſume himſelfe with faſting,
yet not any beame of light and love, that the revolting ſoule ſhall ſee
in the countenance of God, to take hold on, and to comfort himſelfe by. Hence
'tis that the Pſalmiſt complains of God and his mercy as cleane gone.
<hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? is
his mercy cleane gone for ever? doth his promiſe faile for 
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9267:95"/>evermore? Pſal.</hi> 77.7,8. Nay, many times God
ſerves back-ſliding Chriſtians, as he ſerved the Iſraelites of old,
to wit, increaſes their ſorrow, when they are in earneſt ſuit for
releaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; ſo farre he is from pittying of them: and as
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> carried himſelfe to his brethren; inſtead of pittying
them in their want, he ſpake affrightingly to them, and told them that they
were ſpies, and ſo put them in feare of the loſſe of their lives.
Juſt thus for a time doth God uſually carry himſelfe to revolting
Chriſtians: he is ſo farre from pittying them, notwithſtanding all their
prayers, that he calls them dogges, and ſpeakes roughly to them, and puts
them in feare of the loſſe of their beſt lives, and ſeemes reſolved
to proceed againſt them as his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, begge and cry as long as they will.
<hi>Job</hi> points at this, where he ſaith, <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy
face, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt me for thin-enemy? Iob</hi> 13.24. And is not this hell
indeed, to be in ſoule miſery, and to have no compaſſion from God? To
be pittied and condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a mans friend, though he be not 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:9267:95"/>able to helpe him, we take it as a great mercy, and
moderation of miſery; <hi>Iob</hi> would ſo have accounted it. But when
ſuch as we take for friends, doe not onely forbeare to pitty, but ſet
themſelves againſt us in our miſery, and adde to our afflictions; this
makes miſery unſpeakeably miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a lively Embleme of Hell
indeed: But I goe no further this way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the ſorrow which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cauſeth upon the
breach of ſincerity, is unſpeakeable ſtrong no other in a manner but the
torments of hell; ſo 'tis oft times unſpeakable ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. As the Wind
raiſes hideous ſtormes and tempeſts at Sea on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that endangers
the drowning of all: So conſcience, when once the ſoule hath turned aſide
to crooked waies, oft times of a ſudden raiſes hideous ſtorms and
tempeſts in the ſoule, which addes exceedingly to the torture. Horrour and
terrour breaking forth ſuddenly, affrights more by farre, then if it came
with warning. The fire that conſcience kindles in the ſoule, 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:9267:96"/>is like the ſetting a fire of Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, very
ſudden, as 'tis very fierce. After once a breach is made upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
conſcience laies traines of wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, and blowes up all a mans joy on an
inſtant, and ſets on fire the ſoule, and then lets in legions of ſuch
ſpirits whoſe dwelling is onely in fire to keep Garriſon againſt all
promiſes of good to this ſoule, and then the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like
<hi>Taſhur, feare round about:</hi> the face of God terrible; the face of
friends terrible; the thought of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, death; and the thought of
death, hell; and the thought of hell, as at the doore, and unavoidable. As the
Arrowes which God will ſhoot, againſt the enemies of his Church, ſhall
goe forth as lightening, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.14. ſo the Arrowes which God
ſhootes by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, againſt ſuch as turne aſide to evill waies,
they goe forth oft-times as light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ings, very ſudden, &amp; very ſwift. Sometimes when a ſinner
like <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> is in the very act of ſinne, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence writes
downe a mans doome in his heart, and in ſuch legible letters, that the
ſinner cannot chooſe but read <pb n="175" facs="tcp:9267:96"/>and tremble. When a
ſinner is taking pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe, of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
conſcience breaks forth into thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and lightning in the ſoule, and the
ſinner is as one deſcending quicke into hell. <hi>And [immediately while he
yet ſpake] the Cocke crew, and the Lord look'd backe upon Peter,</hi> ſaith
the text, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.60. On a ſudden, while <hi>Peter</hi> was in the
very act of denying, a cocke crew within, to wit, conſcience that made
<hi>Peters</hi> ſpirit die within him. Once and twiſe <hi>Peter</hi> denied
Chriſt, and Chriſt did not awaken conſcience, and ſet him at him, to
pull him by the throat; but the third time, <hi>immediately while he yet
ſpake,</hi> conſcience like a Lyon ranne upon his ſoule, and made him
beleeve, that hee would be a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentour to him, as he is to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
before the time. Sometime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may let a man alone, after he is turned
aſide from ſincere walking, but if the ſoule ſtill goe on, of a
ſudden conſcience will break forth, into thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and lightning ſo
fiercely as he did in <hi>Peters</hi> ſoule, on whom if Chriſt had not
look'd backe, <hi>Peter</hi> would <pb n="176" facs="tcp:9267:97"/>have gone neere, to
have ſerved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as <hi>Iudas,</hi> after he had betrayed his
Maſter.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, This I am ſure, O ſincere ſoule, that as
conſcience will make thee know to thy comfort, that 'tis a ſweet thing
faithfully and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to ſerve God; ſo conſcience will make thee
know to thy griefe, that it is an evill and a bitter thing, to turne away from
the good way of the Lord. Having therefore now ſet good and evill before
thee, make a wiſe choyce. Chuſe rather to undergoe any thing, that man or
divell can invent, that thou maiſt ſtill enjoy the peace and joy of a good
conſcience, then to have the greateſt honour this world will afford, and
ſhipwracke ſincerity, and ſo lie liable to the laſh of an evill
conſcience.</p>

ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity after a ſpeciall manner to be declared, are when a man is
ſtrongly aſſaulted by the world, the fleſh or the divell, to ſinne
againſt God; or elſe ſtrongly hindred in ſeeking the glory of God, and
the good of his Church. When <hi>Simon</hi> the ſorcerer ſaw, that through

<hi>Peter</hi> money to impart his skill unto him, and ſo to have made him a

he abhorred all unjuſt waies to get wealth, and that he was not mercenary in
his Miniſtery, as the world might ſuppoſe; which he wiſely
conſidered, and anſwerably carried himſelfe. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtood up,

the people being ſtrongly ſet to have a King, as other Nations had, not
liking their governement by Judges; then was a ſpeciall perſonall
occaſion from the world, for <hi>Samuel</hi> to declare his integrity, that
he had walked faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Gods Vicegerent over them, and had given them no

conſequently that they did evill to deſire a King. <hi>And Samuel ſaid to

he wiſely conſidered, and anſwerably with courage declared himſelfe
<hi>Then Saul who alſo is called Paul, filled with the Holy Chriſt, ſet

of the heart, are the enemies of a mans owne houſe, which are the worſt

elſe God will give up the heart to the power and dominion of ſinne, and
then the ſoule is undone for ever. This <hi>Paul</hi> wiſely

to countermine all his enchantments, which they ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered,

then was a ſpeciall Nationall occaſion indeed for <hi>Moſes</hi> to

all honours and preferments this world could afford him, and that he loved the
glory of God (which would have beene much blemiſhed by the heathen, if he had
deſtroyed <hi>Iſrael</hi>) more than his owne life; which be ſeriouſly

            <p>The reaſons why God in the courſe of his providence, brings
about, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occaſions for the declaration of ſincerity, are theſe;
Firſt, that the world and the divell may ſee, that his people are indeed
ſincere. Speciall occaſions of triall, are like <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars</hi>
fiery Furnace, heat ſeven times hotter then ordinary, which will tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
diſcover Gold from droſſe. Theſe made knowne <hi>Iobs</hi> ſincerity
ſo univerſally, that all mouthes were ſtopt, which ſtrangely thought

children, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and call Gods people hypocrits; ſuch as doe not ſerve
God for nought, but follow Chriſt for loaves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe religion for

amiſſe of the generation of the juſt, brings his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as 'twere upon
the ſtage, in the <pb n="197" facs="tcp:9267:107"/>open view of all, and puts them upon

glory of God, and to be of uſe for man: So thoſe ſtars which God hath
placed in the leſſer world, to wit, the ſoule of man, ſome of them God

but others againe God would they ſhould declare them as much as may be, to
his glory and the good of others, as love, and ſincerity, that they may
ſparkle in the eyes of all the world, as glorious beames of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Image. Now man being too back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this worke voluntarily, God makes and
fits occaſions and times for <pb n="198" facs="tcp:9267:108"/>the very purpoſe, that
ſhall ſitt a man throughly, and ſound his heart to the bottome, and
turn-his inſide outward, and ſo declare his ſincerity or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie to
all the world. As God knowes who are his; ſo he will have the divell and his
children to know alſo who are his; that they may walke as ſelfe-condemned
wretches, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, for perſecuting of them. Now, to effect this,
this is the thing God does, <hi>viz,</hi> he makes bitter pills for his
children to ſwallow, heavie burthens for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to beare, ſuch as no
unſound heart would touch, with one of his fingers; he heates Furnaces
ſeven times hotter then ordinary, and throwes his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into them; one
thing or other God ſo orders, that ſhall put his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to it, to ſee
what mettle they be made of; that ſhall anatomiſe every ſtring in their
hearts, ſo that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and all his children, to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and
torment, ſhall read ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity written in their hearts, with capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
letters.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2</note>The ſecond reaſon why God in the
courſe of his providence, brings about <pb n="199" facs="tcp:9267:108"/>ſpeciall
occaſions for the declaration of ſincerity, is, that his owne glory may
thereby be greatly advanced. Speciall cures they winne a name to a
Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, more then the ordinary cures of ſeven yeeres practice:
likewiſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall victories, win their prime agents more honour, then all
the ordinary warfare of their whole life: So God by carrying his people through
ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all occaſions of triall magnifies the glory of his power, wiſedome,
and love, more then a thouſand ordinary paſſages of his providence
towards them. What a name for power, God wonne to himſelfe, in the heart of
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and the three children, for ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them with ſuch
courage, to ſtop the mouthes of Lyons, and to quench the violence of fire; to
expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the mercy of Lyons, and fire; rather then to wrong
their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This doubtleſſe made them more to ſing of the power
and goodneſſe of the Lord, then all the paſſages of his providence
towards them, in the whole courſe of their lives before. Some skilfull
Phyſitians will make <pb n="200" facs="tcp:9267:109"/>their men ſwallow this or that
ſtrong poiſon, that they may ſhew their skill before multitudes in curing
of them, to winne them a name: So God he puts his people to great plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges oft
times, that he may winne them a name for ever in their hearts, and in the
hearts of all beholders, for wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, and mercy in carrying them
ſweetly thorough all, without making ſhipwracke of faith and a good
conſcience. This know, that 'tis Gods great worke in this world to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his owne Name, and to make it great to the ends of the earth: now, amongſt
the many notable waies, he hath to magnifie his Name, this is one, and not the
meaneſt, to wit, to put his people upon ſpeciall occaſions, of the triall
of their ſincerity, and by theſe, ſuch an art hath God to advance his
owne honour, that he winnes a world of hearts to himſelfe at once, that will
be ſo many living Trumpets to ſound forth the praiſe of his
greatneſſe and goodneſſe, from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God by his providence <pb n="201" facs="tcp:9267:109"/>brings about
ſpeciall occaſions for the tryall of ſincerity, to adde to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the divell and his children. Great trials of the godly, put the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and
his children in hope of their utter ruine. When <hi>Haman</hi> had prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſo farre, as to get a bloody decree againſt the Jewes, he then joyed
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, as one that promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe their utter ruine: now God
ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in betweene, and on a ſudden turning this triall of
<hi>Mordecai's</hi> to his advantage, and to <hi>Hamans</hi> diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to his honour, and <hi>Hamans</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, no man can tell, nor hardly
conceive, how this added to <hi>Hamans</hi> torture. God hath admirable waies,
to make wicked men gnaſh their teeth, before they come to Hell; and amongſt
the many admirable waies, which God hath for this end, this is not one of the
meaneſt, to put the wicked into a kind of hope, of having their will upon the
godly, by giving the godly in part (for trials ſake) into their hands, and
then on a ſudden, ſnatching them farther out of their power, then ever they
were before, <pb n="202" facs="tcp:9267:110"/>and making them engins of the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of
the wicked. This hath made many a proud malicious wretch, hang himſelfe,
ſtabbe himſelfe, poiſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to wiſh himſelfe any where, ſo
he were but out of the ſight and talke of them that feare God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God in the courſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, brings about
ſpeciall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the triall and diſcovery of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, that
ſo the joy of the upright may be augmented, in this life, and in the life to
come. Speciall trials of ſincerity, ſincerely gone through, they procure
joy unſpeakable and full of glory in this life; and they worke about joy
unconceivable and full of glory in the life to come. There is joy in this life
for the godly, and joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory. So there is a reward
in Heaven for the godly, and a <hi>great reward,</hi> as Chriſt uſeth the
epithete. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.12. Now, unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy, God gives to them that
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe unſpeakable trials of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; he gives full flaggons of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, to ſuch as have beene ſoarely ſhot at, as the
expreſſion is uſed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <pb n="203" facs="tcp:9267:110"/>
               <hi>Ioſeph,
Gen.</hi> 49.23. &amp; yet have kept faithfull to their God. So the great
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven, is kept for them, that undergoe great trials on earth, and
yet hold faſt their integrity. As Princes have their waies to advance men to
great honour, honourably; to wit, by putting them upon ſome notable hard and
difficult ſervice, and if they acquit themſelves well and faithfully in it,
then to conferre great honour upon them, not otherwiſe: So the King of Kings
he hath his honourable waies, to advance meane Chriſtians to great
ſpirituall dignities, here and hereafter: and amongſt many others this is
one, namely, to put them upon ſpeciall trials, and difficult taskes and
ſervices, that ſhall put every nerve and ſinew to it; and diſcharging
themſelves well and faithfully in theſe, then he puts a <hi>long white robe
upon them, and palmes in their hands,</hi> great ſpirituall dignities, that
ſo they may be knowne to all, to be ſuch as <hi>came out of great
tribulation,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14.</p>
            <p>This doctrine findeth fault with two ſorts of perſons,
<hi>viz,</hi> Such as of wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <pb n="204" facs="tcp:9267:111"/>and ſuch as
of weakneſſe, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and paſſe by ſpeciall times and occaſions,
for the declaration of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
            <p>Men wilfully paſſe by ſpeciall times and occaſions, for
the declaration of ſincerity, when they ſhut their eyes, and will not take
notice of ſuch times; out of ſome ſelfe-reſpect. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes of this fort of men, where he ſaith; <hi>Let
favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet [will he not] learne
righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in the Land of uprightneſſe [will be deale
unjuſtly] [and will not] behold the Majeſty of the Lord. Lord when thy hand
is lifted up, [they will not ſee:] but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed
for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie at the people, &amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 26.10,11. God gave
ſpeciall times to this generation of men, to mend their manners, and to
declare uprightneſſe in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to his glory, but though this
ſpeciall favour were ſhewed them, yet <hi>would they not,</hi> ſo much as
ſet about, to learne righteouſneſſe, to acquaint their deluded
conſcience with what was right, and to be practiſed by them. God in a very
majeſticall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <pb n="205" facs="tcp:9267:111"/>lifted up his hand againſt them,
to croſſe and curſe them in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt waies, and all to this end,
that they ſhould behold it, and take ſhame to themſelves, and breake off
from their unrighteous courſes, and they wilfully ſhut their eyes, that
they might not <hi>behold the Majeſty of God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. God gave
them (of his rich favour) ſpeciall times and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, to declare
uprightneſſe, and they made them ſpeciall times and occaſions, to
declare their pride and rottenneſſe. There is an iron ſinew in the will
of men naturally, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let God give never ſo faire op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
and occaſions to them, to ſhew themſelves for him and for his righteous
waies, yet they will not bow and ſtoope unto it. This iron ſinew was in the
necke of <hi>Saul,</hi> and therefore God called his ſinne, in not ſlaying
all the <hi>Amalekits,</hi> when he gave him a ſpeciall opportunity
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>ſtubbornneſſe and Rebellion.</hi> God ſaw more into
<hi>Sauls</hi> ſinne then he, or many of us could imagine. He look'd upon
<hi>Sauls</hi> will, in ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> when <pb n="206" facs="tcp:9267:112"/>he
might have killed him; and God ſaw that <hi>Sauls</hi> will was reſolutely
ſet to doe this, what ever hypocriticall plea he made for himſelfe, and
what ever expreſſe charge he had to the contrary. God gave to <hi>Saul</hi>
there, a ſpeciall opportunity wherein to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſincerity, and he as
a ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willed wretch, made it a ſpeciall time wherein to declare his
hypocriſie, to his utter diſgrace and ruine both of ſoule and body.</p>
            <p>Pride and malice are the cauſe, why men wilfully paſſe by
ſpeciall times, for the declaration of ſincerity. God gave to
<hi>Herod</hi> a ſpeciall time wherein to declare ſincerity, by cauſing
that promiſed branch, to ſpring out of the roote of <hi>Ieſſe</hi> in
his time, which roote was thought to have been quite dead. Here was ſuch an
opportunity given <hi>Herod,</hi> to declare his love to Chriſt, by
protecting and countenancing of him, as was given to no Ruler before him; and
he out of pride and malice, as one that could not endure, that there ſhould
be any other King of the Jewes beſides himſelfe, ſought with all his 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:9267:112"/>policy and might to kill him, ſo farre was he from
uſing all his regall power, to protect and fence this choice branch from
ſpoilers. God gave likewiſe to the learned Scribes and Phariſes,
ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occaſions for the declaration of ſincerity, by cauſing him
that was the wiſdome of God to converſe amongſt them, and to ſpeake as
never man ſpake, and to doe thoſe things which never man did; that ſo
they (as <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, according to what they had heard with
their eares, and ſeene with their eyes, might magnifie him, and labour as
Gods faithfull Miniſters in their place, to bring all men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him,
and follow him; and they out of pride and malice, uſed all their craft and
might, to cruſh him in the ſhell, to nip him in the very bud, to cloud his
glorious ſunne, as ſoone as riſen, that none might ſee his light and
walke in it.</p>
            <p>Such wretches as theſe, who wilfully ſhunne ſpeciall times
and occaſions for the declaration of ſincerity, muſt be told this, That
their ſinne is very great, and anſwerable ſhall be their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:9267:113"/>unleſſe they repent. That your ſinne is great,
appeares by the example of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſinning in this very kind. God gave
him a ſpeciall occaſion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſincerity to him, when he gave
all the <hi>Amalekites</hi> into his hands; he wilfully taking his owne
courſe, and pleaſing his owne humour, you know how God calls this ſinne,
viz, <hi>stubburnneſſe; Rebellion;</hi> rebellion parallel to
<hi>Witch-craft, Rejecting the word of the Lord.</hi> God will no otherwiſe
account your ſinne, who now wilfully paſſe by occaſions and
opportunities of declaring your ſincerity to him. He will account your
practice, <hi>ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe:</hi> and did any man ever ſtout it out
with God, and proſper? He will account your practiſe <hi>Rebellion:</hi>
and did ever any man play the rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, that was not hangd and
quartered? He will account your practiſe <hi>a rejecting of his Word:</hi>
and for this God will certainely reject you. You know well what heavy
puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God inflicted upon <hi>Saul</hi> for this ſinne: he ſtript
him of his Kingdome, nay, he ſtript him of the holy Ghoſt, 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:9267:113"/>ten thouſand times more worth then his Kingdome, and
gave him up to an evill ſpirit, to be vexed and whorried headlong into great
ſinnes, and great miſeries; 
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pares pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
pares.</hi>
               </note> and according to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of divine juſtice,
muſt you looke to be dealt withall. God offers you now golden opportunities,
to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your ſincerity to him, by killing all <hi>Amalekits,</hi> every
ſinne in your ſoules, which are more abominable to him, then ever was the
<hi>Amalekits,</hi> and to the killing of all, he promiſeth you his
aſſiſting of all, he promiſeth you his aſſiſting grace, as he
cauſed his victorious arme to goe along with <hi>Saul;</hi> and if now you
wilfully ſpare ſome one <hi>Agag,</hi> ſome fat of the Kine, ſome
ſinnes, that bring you in pleaſure and profit, looke for <hi>Sauls</hi>
ſauce to ſuch ſweet meats. God will take his ſpirit utterly from you,
and give you up to your owne hearts luſts, to commit wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe with
greedineſſe, to the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of your condemnation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the doctrine in hand, 
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſt debilitas culpabilis, ſicut
excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabilis.</hi>
               </note> finds fault with ſuch as paſſe by ſpeciall
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and times, for the declaration of ſincerity, out of
weakeneſſe: under <pb n="210" facs="tcp:9267:114"/>this head foure ſorts of
perſons are to be reproved. Firſt, ſuch as through ignorance paſſe by
ſpeciall times and occaſions, for the declaration of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Many men
in place have often by the providence of God, ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and times
put upon them, for the declaration of their ſincere love to Chriſt and his
members, 
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ignorantia normae, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia culpabilis,
eſt.</hi>
               </note> but being ignorant of what is indeed ſincerity, to wit,
what is indeed right, and the thing to be ſtood for, doe nothing, ſhew
themſelves neuters, or elſe doe as the moſt doe. Some though they have a
long time lived in the light, and ſhould be able to diſtinguiſh betweene
light and darkeneſſe, yet through a careleſſe improvement of the light,
and reſting in cuſtomes, know not what is indeed the exact will of God to
be ſtood for; and therefore when they are by the providence of God, brought
upon the ſtage, to ſet their ſeale to Gods truth, they as fooles, ſay
and doe they know not what.</p>
            <p>Others there are, who though not ignorant of what is indeed right
and good, but yet ignorant of the danger <pb n="211" facs="tcp:9267:114"/>which may
enſue upon the neglect of any opportunity for the declaration of ſincerity,
paſſe by one ſpeciall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and promiſe to themſelves
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and god greadventure preſently proceeds againſt them in a
ſtrict way of judicature, to the deſerting of their ſoules, and never
brings about ſuch a golden opportunity more unto them, wherein to ſhew
themſelves ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably for him. <hi>Salomon</hi> points at this where he
ſaith, <hi>Becauſe to every purpoſe there is time and judgement:
therefore the miſery of man is great upon him, Eccl.</hi> 8.6. The miſery
of man is great upon him indeed, that is either ignorant of <hi>judgement</hi>
(1) of what is right, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; or that is ignorant of <hi>time:</hi>
that is of ſuch ſpeciall and ſit opportunities as God offers to man, for
the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of, and ſtanding for, what is right and good. You that are
igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>judgement;</hi> of what is right to be done or ſuffered, you
will by the example of others be drawne to ſtand againſt right, inſtead
of ſtanding for it, as did the ignorant multitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt,
concerning whom the <pb n="212" facs="tcp:9267:115"/>Apoſtle ſpeakes thus, <hi>That
had they known it, they had not crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. The ignorant Jewes not knowing <hi>judgement,</hi> were by
the example of the learned Scribes and Phariſes, drawne to ſtand againſt
Chriſt, inſtead of ſtanding for him, and ſo pulled the guilt of
innocent blood upon them, which is not yet waſhed off.</p>
            <p>You that are ignorant of <hi>time;</hi> of the ſpeciall
occaſions and times, which God in the courſe of his providence brings
about, for the declaration of ſincerity, and of the dangers which enſue
thereupon, muſt be told this, That you will open great gaps unto evill, ere
you are aware. Old <hi>Ely</hi> not taking that ſpeciall occaſion given
him, to declare his ſincerity, by a due puniſhment upon his ſonnes, they
grew horribly wicked, and Gods wrath grew quickly unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hot.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let me tell you this, That you blindfoldly paſſe by
the choyſeſt times of your life, to advance your owne happineſſe both
here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <pb n="213" facs="tcp:9267:115"/>
               <hi>Phinehas</hi> for taking that
ſpeciall time which God gave him, to declare his ſincere love to him, wonne
a great deale of honour to himſelfe and poſterity. And ſo likewiſe
<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> who tooke hold of that ſpeciall time that God gave him to
declare his ſincerity; <hi>Who ſaid to his father and to his mother, I have
not ſeene him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren; nor knew his owne
children, Deut.</hi> 33.9. wonne unſpeakeable honour. So likewiſe
<hi>Abraham</hi> in taking that ſpeciall time which God gave him, to trie the
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his love in putting on to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his onely ſonne, won
incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dignity.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, ſuch as through carnall
feare paſſe by ſpeciall occaſions for the declaration of ſincerity,
are here to be blamed. This I thinke was <hi>Pilats</hi> caſe. God gave a
ſpeciall time unto him, for the declaration of ſincere love to Chriſt,
when Chriſt was brought as a malefactour before him, and yet nothing worthy
of death or of bonds could be found againſt him. But <hi>Pilat</hi> out of
feare to diſpleaſe the Jewes, <pb n="214" facs="tcp:9267:116"/>paſſed by this
golden opportunity, and paſſed Sentence upon the innocent. This was
<hi>Peters</hi> weakeneſſe. God gave him a ſpeciall occaſion for the
decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſincere love to Chriſt, when the Damoſell ſo hardly put
him to it, and yet he out of feare, paſſed by this golden opportunity,
&amp; denyed Chriſt with all vehemency, which he ſhould with all
boldneſſe and fervour then have confeſſed.</p>
            <p>Such as theſe may doe well to keepe theſe two Scriptures
ſtill in their minds: <hi>I, even I am he that comforteth you, Who art thou
that ſhouldſt be afraid of a man that ſhall die, and of the ſonne of
man that ſhall be made as graſſe, Iſa.</hi> 51.12. <hi>But whoſoever
ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny, before my father which is
in Heaven, Math.</hi> 10.33.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch may doe well alſo to conſider this, That they
will brand their name with everlaſting reproch; rob God of more honour,
through their cowardlyneſſe, then their ſoules are worth, though rated
above all this world; and rob themſelves of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of glody, which
reſts tranſcendently <pb n="215" facs="tcp:9267:116"/>upon ſuffering Chriſtians,
as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuch as paſſe by ſpeciall times for the
declaration of ſincerity, through carnall perſwaſion, are here to be
blamed. The man of God which cryed againſt the Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> was
faulty in this kind. God gave to him a ſpeciall occaſion to declare his
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love to him, when that old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet perſwaded him to doe contrary
to his commiſſion, but he being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne with the ſmooth language of
the Prophet, returned backe with him, and did eate bread and drinke water,
contrary to the expreſſe command of God. How the man of God was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for this, ſuch ſhall doe well to thinke of, that are apt to have an eare
open to carnall counſell and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be turned thereby from
taking hold of ſpeciall times for the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſincerity. Three
examples more there be, which are moſt worthy of theſe mens
conſideration, which would have this weakeneſſe cured in them. The
firſt is the example of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in his carriage to his Miſtris;
He <pb n="216" facs="tcp:9267:117"/>would not admit of diſcourſe with her, nor ſtand
to hearken to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſwaſions, but ſpeedily breaks away from her
company and counſell both. The ſecond, is the example of <hi>Paul,</hi>
that would not conſult with fleſh and blood, when he was to take hold of
ſpeciall occaſions and times, for the declaration of his ſincere love to
Chriſt. The third is the example of Chriſt himſelfe, in his carriage to
<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who when he ſought to perſwade him to ſpare himſelfe,
ſaid, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, ſuch as out of carnall
pity, paſſe by ſpeciall occaſions for the declaration of ſincerity,
are by this doctrine to be blamed. Good old <hi>Ely</hi> was faulty in this
kind. Out of pitty to his ſonnes he forbore to doe that which he ſhould
have done, to have declared his ſincere love to the glory of God. Let ſuch
as are faulty in this kind, thinke on <hi>Elies</hi> miſery to humble them;
and on theſe divine exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples following, to reforme them. Thinke on
<hi>Levi,</hi> who ſheathed his ſword in the bowels of his brethren, 
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:9267:117"/>nay, he knew not his father nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no, nor the
children of his loynes, that he might declare his ſincere love to the glory
of God, when opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was offered. Thinke on <hi>Gideon,</hi> who threw
downe the Altar of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he might declare his ſincere love to
God, when he called him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Thinke on <hi>Aſa's</hi> dethroning his
mother, and ſtamping her idols to pouder, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.16. And on
<hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> denying the requeſt of his good mother
<hi>Bathſheba,</hi> when ſhe requeſted a bad thing, to wit,
<hi>Abiſhag</hi> the Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namite, for <hi>Adonijah,</hi> which was given to
lie in <hi>Davids</hi> boſome in his old age to keepe him warme, and to
cheriſh him. All theſe worthies were not ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fooliſh pitty; but
looked over all relations, to obey the will of God, and to declare their
ſincere love to him, upon all occaſions offered.</p>
            <p>Wherefore:</p>
            <p>The ſecond and laſt uſe of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſhall be fore
exhortation. Seeing there be ſpeciall times and occaſions for the
delcaration of ſincerity, and that many have broken thorough all 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:9267:118"/>impediments, to take hold of them, let us alſo ſtrive
thus to doe. Two things I would exhort you to; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch times; and
ſecondly, to take faſt hold of them. Seeing there be ſpeciall times for
the declaration of ſincerity, let us give all diligence to obſerve, when
they are by God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us. Shut not your eyes againſt ſuch times; nor
through ignorance, and careleſſeneſſe over-looke ſuch times.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi>
               </note>But how ſhould I know
ſpeciall times and occaſions for the declaration of ſincerity?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note>I anſwer, by theſe
three things. Firſt by the dependancy of Gods glory and thine owne eternall
good, upon times, occaſions, and actions. If the glory of God, and thine owne
eternall good depend much upon the doing or ſuffering of this or that thing;
ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, that if not performed, both Gods glory and thine owne peace fall
to the ground; this is a ſpeciall time and occaſion for the declaration of
ſincerity; and therefore obſerve it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:9267:118"/>Secondly, by ſtrong internall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and
movings to this or that duty, together with the hand of God exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in a
ſpeciall manner, by mercies and corrections ſeconding. 'Tis ſaid (you
know) that the ſpirit of the Lord moved <hi>Sampſon</hi> at times in the
campe of <hi>Dan.</hi> That is, God after a ſpeciall manner ſtirred him up
now and then, to that great worke of fighting with the Philiſtins, to which
he had aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him. So likewiſe now, the Spirit of God doth at times,
move mens hearts, after a powerfull and ſpeciall manner, to this duty or
that, to the mortification of this luſt or that; and ſeconds this ſtrong
internall motion, by ſuch mercies and corrections, as may moſt ſuitably
tend to further this motion, and ſpurre on backward man, to the performance
of this duty. This is a ſpeciall time for the declaration of ſincerity;
obſerve it. <hi>Balaam</hi> (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) had ſpeciall motions and
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſtirrings not to goe about to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the
Angell of the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeconding to hinder him; and yet for all this
ſword within, and ſword <pb n="220" facs="tcp:9267:119"/>without, he would on. You
that will doe as he did, muſt looke to fare as he did. So on the other hand,
<hi>Mordecai</hi> (doubtleſſe) had ſtrong internall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and
ſtirrings to labour for the good of the Jewes, and the downefall of proud
<hi>Haman;</hi> and the providence of God externally, after a ſpeciall manner
ſeconding; which he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and anſwerably moved in this gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
opportunity, and ſo wonne much honour to God, to himſelfe, and good to his
Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the word of God. The word of God is ſo full and
perfect, that it plainely ſets before every man that ſtudies it, what is of
weight to be done, and what is of moment not to be done. It ſets forth things
to be done, or not to be done, with all the circumſtances about them, which
makes them of more ſpeciall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or leſſe. So that if a man
looke upon an action or occaſion by the word of God, he ſhall preſently
be able to ſee, of what conſequence the thing is, and how anſwerably he
is to move in and about it, whether with <pb n="221" facs="tcp:9267:119"/>more or
leſſe care and diligence. Hence 'tis that Chriſt willed thoſe which he
urged to imbrace him, to ſearch the Scriptures concerning him; intimating
that there they ſhould ſee, of what conſequence this worke was, of
imbracing Chriſt, and following him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as I would have you to take notice, ſo I would have
you to take hold of ſpeciall times and occaſions for the declaration of
ſincerity. When you have eſpied theſe golden opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, faſten
upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi>
               </note>But how ſhould I take
hold of theſe golden opportunities aright?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, the taking hold of theſe golden opportunities
aright, conſiſts in theſe three things, <hi>viz,</hi> That a man when
ſuch times are brought about to him, by the providence of God, ſet
himſelf, firſt, ſpeedily; and ſecondly, thoroughly, to anſwer them;
and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he goe about all in the ſtrength of Chriſt. Firſt a
man that would take hold aright of ſpeciall times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for the
declaration of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt be ſpeedy in this worke. 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:9267:120"/>Time, we ſay, tarries for no man. And opportunity is
the extract, and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of time, and farre more gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Opportunity let ſlip, poſſibly a man may have never ſuch another,
though he ſhould live an hundred yeares. Hence 'tis that Chriſt ſpeakes
ſo dolefully to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which had ſlipt her opportunity,
<hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, if thou hadſt knowne in this thy day, the
things that belong to thy peace! but now they are hidden from thine
eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as you muſt ſet your ſelves ſpeedily, ſo you
muſt ſet your ſelves throughly to this worke, if you would take hold of
theſe golden op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities aright. That is, you muſt ſet your ſelves
to declare ſincerity, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the occaſions and ſpeciall
opportunitie which God offereth. For this is to take hold of theſe precious
opportunities aright, to wit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all occaſions for the declaration
of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity preſent themſelves, after a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner, to declare
our ſincerity in them. When a ſpeciall occaſion of this kinde was offered
to <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>Peters</hi> Judaizing, you know with what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:9267:120"/>and ſpirit <hi>Paul</hi> declared himſelfe
anſwerable to the occaſion. <hi>To whom I gave place, not for a moment.
Whom I withſtood to the face, for he was to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, Gal</hi> 2. And
<hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe though a very meeke, quiet, and patient ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
man, yet when a ſpeciall occaſion for the declaration of his ſincerity
was offered, by <hi>Aaron</hi> and the peoples ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Calte, with what a
Lyon-like courage did he ſhew himſelfe? And old <hi>Ely</hi> becauſe he
did not ſet himſelfe thus to declare his ſincerity, when his ſons of
provoked God, to wit, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that ſpeciall occaſion offered, you
know what conſtruction God made of his mild cold carriage, in that urgent
waighty matter, betweene God and his ſonnes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a man that would declare ſincerity aright in all
occaſions offered thereunto, muſt ſet about this worke in the ſtrength
of Chriſt, and not in any ſtrength of his owne. <hi>I will goe in the
ſtrength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy rightouſneſſe even
of thine onely, Pſalm.</hi> 71.16. <hi>I will goe in the ſtrength of the
Lord God, &amp;c.</hi> That is <pb n="224" facs="tcp:9267:121"/>in every deſigne, and in
every buſineſſe I will depend wholly upon the aide and aſſiſtance
of God, and upon no ſtrength of my owne. Thus we know <hi>David</hi> went
againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> when he would declare his ſincere love to God,
whom <hi>Goliah</hi> blaſphemed. Thus muſt we doe when ever we ſet upon
any opportunity, wherein to declare our ſincere love to God, or elſe we
ſhall doe as <hi>Peter,</hi> deny Chriſt, inſtead of ſtanding for him
anſwerably to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered.</p>
            <p>Now, that what hath beene ſaid touching this point, of taking
hold of golden opportunities offered, for the declaration of ſincerity, you
may all obſerve and follow, thinke on theſe two or three things. God calles
for it: Conſcience calls for it: Church and State calls for it: Soule and
body will elſe ſeverely ſmart for it. Firſt, thinke on this, God calls
for this at our hands, that we ſhould declare ſincerity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the
ſpeciall occaſions calling thereunto. <hi>Gather your ſelves together,
&amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Lord to the diſobedient Jewes, and in them to us,
before the <pb n="225" facs="tcp:9267:121"/>decree come forth, before the fierce anger of
the Lord come upon you. <hi>Seeke ye the Lord all ye meeke of the earth,
ſeeke righteouſneſſe, ſeeke meekeneſſe: it may be ye ſhall be
hid in the day of the Lords anger. Zeph.</hi> 2.1,2,3. A ſpeciall time was
offered, wherein to ſhew themſelves for God and for good, and God called
upon them carefully to take it, as they tendered their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and eternall
good.</p>
            <p>God calls us now to the declaration of ſincerity, as by his
word, ſo by his workes, both of mercy and juſtice. God hath loaded us with
mercies and corrections of all ſorts, and all for this end, that we ſhould
declare our ſincere love to him, anſwerable to all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities offered
hereunto. <hi>Many a time</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith) <hi>hath he turned
away his anger,</hi> and hath not made a full end of us, when we have highly
provoked him thereunto, and all for this end, that we ſhould declare our
ſincere love to him, anſwerable to all opportunities offered thereunto. To
the language of the Lord by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> I may fitly here allude.
God <pb n="226" facs="tcp:9267:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath withholden the raine from us, when there
have beene but three months to the harveſt: God hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to raine
upon one ſhire and county, and not upon another: God hath ſmitten us with
blaſting and Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew; and all this to bring us to declare a ſincere love to
him, according to all opportunities offered; and yet we are backward hereunto.
God hath ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us with the peſtilence againe and againe; and with the
ſword hath he threatned us againe and againe, and all this to bring us on to
declare a ſincere love to him, according to all occaſions offered; and yet
we are backward hereunto. <hi>Therefore thus will I doe unto thee,</hi> ſaith
the Lord to <hi>Iſrael, and becauſe I will doe thus, prepare to meet the
Lord thy God, O Iſrael, Amos</hi> 4. So ſay I to you, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as all
the milde meanes which God hath hitherto uſed are not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall for this
end, to bring us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our ſincere love to him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all
opportunities offered, therefore we muſt expect that God will take ſome
ſevere courſe with us for the time to come; and becauſe 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:9267:122"/>we are to expect this at the hands of God, let us prepare
to meet the Lord our God. Let every one of us repent of our halting and
time-ſerving paſt, and for the time to come let us ſet our ſelves to
declare a ſincere love to God, according to all occaſions offered.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2.</note>Conſcience calls us hereunto, as
well as God. Speciall occaſions for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of ſincerity, now ſo
frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo openly ſhew themſelves, that every mans conſcience
tells him, that he ſhould ſhew himſelfe a great deale more then he doth,
for God, his King, and Countrey. As in the night the Owles and the Bats looke
abroad: ſo in theſe darke ſad daies of ſinne and wickedneſſe, the
eyes of Owles and Bats, the eyes of wicked and ſecure ſinners, begin to
open, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences begin to tell them, that they ſhould doe
ſomething more now then they have done, for God, and the good of this Church
and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3.</note>Church and State cals for it. They
both now with one dolefull voice cry out to us, in the language of the
Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt: <hi>Who will riſe up for me againſt the 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:9267:123"/>evill doers? or who will ſtand up for me againſt the
workers of iniquity? Pſal.</hi> 94.16. <hi>They know not, neither will they
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, they walke on in darkneſſe: all the foundations of the earth
are out of courſe. Pſal.</hi> 82.5.</p>
            <p>Finally, ſoule and body will elſe ſeverely ſmart for it,
if we doe not now ſtep in, to take hold of all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for the
declaration of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Curſe ye Meroz (ſaid the Angell of the
Lord) curſe ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof: becauſe they came not to
the helpe of the Lord againſt the mighty, Judg.</hi> 5.23. This curſe may
all ſuch expect who now come not forth, to declare their ſincere love to
Chriſt and his truth, upon all juſt occaſions calling thereunto. The
ſoules of ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as now neglect and put by theſe golden
opportunities, of declaring their ſincere love to Chriſt, will be given up
to lukewarmneſſe, coldneſſe, deadneſſe, hardneſſe, and ſome
to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinateneſſe, and maliciouſneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and all
goodneſſe: which are all ſoule curſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And ſuch bodies as have in 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:9267:123"/>them ſuch curſed ſoules as theſe, you may
aſſure yourſelves, they ſhall meet with miſery enough firſt or
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> intimates
ſomething to this purpoſe, where he ſaith, <hi>At my firſt anſwer no
man ſtood with me, but all men forſook me: I pray God that it may not be
laid to their charge,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. Such as take not hold of
ſpeciall times and occaſions for the declaration of their ſincere love to
Chriſt and his truth, may feare that ſad things will be firſt or laſt,
laid to their charge; ſuch as ſhall make body and ſoule ſhake. Let us
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, as we love our bodies and ſoules, and as we profeſſe love
to Chriſt, which ſhould be dearer to us then our bodies or ſoules, take
hold of all opportunities for the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſincerity. As God brings
about ſpeciall times and occaſions for this end, ſo let every one of us
after a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner, take hold of them, that we may after a ſpeciall
manner be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of God, both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>Dixi.</hi>
